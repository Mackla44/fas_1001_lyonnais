The Ontario and Nova Scotia law societies simply do not like Trinity's Christian code of conduct for its students. In an age that highly values tolerance, this discrimination is the height of intolerance. It is a clear violation of these would-be lawyers' charter right to freedom of religion.

One hundred years ago today, the Duke of Connaught, then Governor General of Canada, arrived with his daughter Princess Patricia to lend royal prestige to Sarnia's inauguration.
Grain elevators, lake-going ships and trains defined life in the early 20th century in the city. The timber, oil and agricultural sector were major parts of its early culture. Sarnia's port was one of the busiest in Canada.
The Great Western and the Grand Trunk Railway played important roles in Sarnia's growth and eventually led to the expansion of Imperial Oil. The Polymer Corporation was created in 1942 to manufacture synthetic rubber during the war, which established Sarnia as a major petrochemical centre.
Today, Sarnia still stands as a bastion of innovation. The biofuels sector leads a renaissance of the petrochemical industry, and new eco-friendly projects are commonplace. Also, our mayor, Mike Bradley, is one of the longest-serving mayors in all of Canada.

 Mr. Speaker...my office was contacted by the office of the chief justice. After I spoke with her on that call, I was of the considered opinion that the Prime Minister did not need to take her call. One thing I can assure the hon. member is that neither the Prime Minister nor I would ever consider calling a judge where that matter is or could be before the court of competent jurisdiction. 
As Acting Speaker McClelland noted on April 1, 1998, and found at pages 5653 of the Debates:
 This is a longstanding tradition in our Parliament that we be cautious when we attack individuals or groups, particularly in the judiciary, and those who are unable to come in here and have the same right of free expression as we enjoy with impunity here. 
A similar sentiment comes from Acting Speaker Thibeault, on June 9, 1998, wherein she said:
 All Speakers of the House have always considered references to magistrates and tribunals unparliamentary when they took the form of a personal attack or blame. I will therefore ask the hon. member to choose his words carefully and to be careful about attacking the court. 
I realize the government may say that this is an issue of parsing words and that its comments are neither blame nor critique. If that is the case, I certainly invite those members to clarify the record lest the impression remain that there is any allegation of wrongdoing on the part of the Chief Justice. However, that still does not solve whether or not the comments were proper in this place.
As Erskine May's Treatise on the Law, Privileges, Proceeding and Usage of Parliament, 24th edition notes, at page 396:
 Certain matters cannot be debated except on a substantive motion which allows a distinct decision of the House. These include the conduct of...persons holding the position of a judge...Such matters cannot, therefore, be raised by way of an amendment, or an adjournment motion. For the same reason, no charge of a personal character in respect of these categories of person can be raised except on a direct and substantive motion. 
This is the key line regarding question period, “No statement of that kind can be...included in reply to a question”.
Previous Speakers have voiced their concern about this practice, finding “comments about the judiciary are out of order”. That is at page 13354 of the Debates, of May 16, 1986, and that “...I am certainly not satisfied with that approach on the appointment of a judge”, regarding a question a member put on September 19, 1991, found at page 2401 of the Debates.
I think my point has been sufficiently made though I must draw the attention of the Chair to a decision of then Speaker Rodolphe Lemieux, dating to February 18, 1926. He said, on page 1106 of the Debates:
 Under the rules of the House: All references to judges and courts of justice and to personages of high official station of the nature of personal attack and censure have always been considered unparliamentary. I would also call the attention of the hon. member to paragraph 234 (i) under rule 19, which says that a member must not: ...cast reflections upon the conduct of judges of superior courts unless such conduct is based upon a substantive motion. 
This idea also forms expression in Beauchesne's Parliamentary Rules &amp; Forms of the House of Commons of Canada, fourth edition, wherein it is written:
 The proper course for persons who feel called upon to attack the conduct of a judge is to proceed by way of a petition in which all the allegations are specifically stated so that the person accused may have full opportunity to answer the charges presented against him. 
What we have seen from the Minister of Justice and the Prime Minister are attacks on the judiciary and a sitting judge, comments imputing motives and maligning the reputation of a person who is not only not able to defend herself in this place, but whose sterling reputation is not even a matter open for debate.
Rather than parse words and dance around this issue, I ask the ministers responsible to withdraw any references made regarding the chief justice that might even remotely cash aspersions upon her conduct.
 While you, Mr. Speaker, would be right to find the minister's comments have been unparliamentary and should be withdrawn, I would suggest for the members in question that rather than seek to defend such comments as permissible exercises, they should seek to clarify any misconceptions that the public may have gleaned from the debate as, indeed, the words we use not only are important as regards the traditions and practices of this place, but echo and resonate across the country to an attentive public.
In short, the government should apologize to the House for its comments that are unparliamentary, likewise apologize to the chief justice, and, similarly, to Canadians for their audacious behaviour that unwarrantedly brings the judiciary into disrepute.
 I would ask all members to join me in congratulating the chief justice on recently beginning the 25th year on the court and for serving all Canadians with great distinction, as we hope she will continue to do for years to come.",Liberal,Charlottetown,Sean Casey,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=e44116f8-75a8-4ca6-9ba5-fe968dbd42b0&Language=E&Section=ALL

Peter MacKay (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, CPC)",,Oral Questions,Points of Order,Oral Questions," Mr. Speaker, I listened very attentively to the hon. member, the justice critic for the Liberal Party, and I was waiting with great anticipation for the point in his presentation when he used actual words that could be attributed to me, and I invite the Speaker, as I know he will, to review Hansard, that would in any way fit the description, which he and others in this place have attributed to comments made by myself or the Prime Minister, that would be categorized as an unprecedented attack, impugning character, imparting motives. That is simply not true. His characterization, similarly, is untrue and unsupported by words that could be attributed to me or found anywhere in Hansard.
On the subject matter, it was not the government that raised this issue in question period. We were responding to questions and, in fact, I would describe them as allegations thrown at myself, the Prime Minister and the government. With respect to not re-arguing or reopening the case, the Leader of the Opposition in particular, in his ever haughty and helpful way, went on to lecture that somehow I and others should have known that the Supreme Court case itself was, to use his language and the language of others, a matter that was unquestionable, that was clear, that was, as some said, well known in legal circles, that an appointment of a Federal Court judge from Quebec was prohibited since the 1870s.
Someone should inform two former Supreme Court justices, Judges Binnie and Charron, a current Supreme Court judge, Mr. Moldaver, who dissented, a current Supreme Court judge, Mr. Rothstein, who came via the Federal Court and, in fact, recused himself, other judges who have come that route through the Federal Court, all current and past sitting Federal Court judges from the province of Quebec, who would have had the audacity to put their names forward for consideration. Perhaps most notably, those who should have known that this decision and this case was well decided and known in legal circles would be members of the parliamentary committee, including the hon. member who just spoke, the justice critic for the NDP party, who, it is now well known, would have seen the list and recommended the list that went forward that contained names of Federal Court judges from Quebec who wished to be considered for a Supreme Court appointment.
This is now, obviously, I would suggest for some, the inside of the inside of a making of a baseball for most Canadians, but the reality is that the government, the Prime Minister and myself sought legal advice, received said advice, and acted appropriately. I also note for the record that this entire subject began when a Supreme Court spokesperson released a statement to the press, to which we felt it was incumbent to respond and clarify.",Conservative,Central Nova,Peter MacKay,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=46dccbed-4370-40f0-975f-d08fe1688aa2&Language=E&Section=ALL

It is up to you to determine if their remarks were parliamentary or if they broke any rules.
One thing is clear, and I know that once we are outside the House, we are no longer under your authority, but the minister seems to have forgotten one thing. This did not start with the chief justice's press release, but it began earlier with a newspaper article that attributed certain comments to unidentified members from the Conservative benches who seemed to be attacking the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada. Those comments were then repeated by the Prime Minister and the minister, without specifying a timeline. The chief justice felt it was important to make that correction.
I agree with those who say that this is an unfortunate incident in our Canadian democracy. I know that, every time the minister rises in the House, knowing full well that we are bound by confidentiality, he suggests things. He very nearly gives me the impression that he is relieving me of my duty of confidentiality concerning what might have happened. However, he was not part of the committee, so I do not expect him to know all of the facts about that.
That being said, regardless of what might have happened, perhaps the Chair should restore a sense of order following this incident. Our democracy is held up by a number of pillars, on of which is the Supreme Court of Canada. The separation of powers is extremely important. As lawyers—and I believe my colleague, the Minister of Justice, is a lawyer, just like me—we are required to ensure that we do not tarnish the administration of justice in Canada.

I would like to thank the member for Saanich—Gulf Islands for raising this matter as well as the Government Leader in the House, the House Leader of the Official Opposition, and the members for Toronto—Danforth, Bas-Richelieu—Nicolet—Bécancour, and Winnipeg North for their comments.
The member for Saanich—Gulf Islands raised concerns that the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs adopted a motion requiring all remaining questions necessary to dispose of its clause-by-clause consideration of the bill to be put by a specified time, effectively creating a deadline for the debate to end. She argued that this motion contradicts an earlier committee order adopted on October 29, 2013, which gives members from non-recognized parties the ability to speak to their suggested amendments to bills before they are voted on by the committee. Because of the imposed deadline, the member's opportunity to speak to her amendments was interfered with, pursuant to the committee order of October 29, 2013. As such, the member for Saanich—Gulf Islands suggested that substantive amendments, even if already voted on by the committee, should be selected for consideration at report stage. Several members rose in support of the member for Saanich—Gulf Islands' point of order.
The government House leader made two central points in response. First, he reminded the House that at report stage the Speaker's authority to select report stage amendments is limited to determining whether they were presented, or could have been presented at committee. Second, he pointed out that the deadline adopted by the committee affected all members the same way, so it is inaccurate to claim that members from unrecognized parties and independents were particularly penalized in this regard.
In examining the matter, it is useful to remind the House of the power of the Speaker to select amendments at report stage. To place the matter in its proper context, it is helpful to refer to the March 21, 2001, statement by Speaker Milliken, found at page 1991 of the Debates, which establishes the guidelines upon which I rely to discharge my responsibility to select amendments at report stage. Speaker Milliken was clear in his intent when he urged:
 …all members and all parties to avail themselves fully of the opportunity to propose amendments during committee stage so that the report stage can return to the purpose for which it was created, namely for the House to consider the committee report and the work the committee has done… 
These principles are also reflected in the interpretive notes attached to Standing Orders 76(5) and 76.1(5). House of Commons Procedure and Practice, Second Edition, further expands on these principles, explaining at pages 783 and 784 that:
 …the Speaker will normally only select motions in amendment that could not have been presented in committee. 
I would remind all members that the guidelines for selection specify whether amendments could have been presented in committee and whether they were defeated in committee. In the case of the committee's consideration of Bill C-23, all members of the committee, as well as any interested independent member, were given the opportunity to present their amendments at committee, and a certain number of these amendments were defeated. The hon. member is now asking the Chair, in exercising its powers of selection, to evaluate whether the consideration afforded such amendments in committee was sufficient.
It is evident that the committee chose to handle its consideration of Bill C-23 in a particular way. A motion setting out the process to be followed was proposed, debated, and ultimately agreed to. Just as the opportunity to present and speak to amendments was decided by way of a committee motion, the deadline by which debate would end likewise was decided by a committee motion. Such decisions are the exclusive responsibility of the committee. I do not believe that it is for the Chair to second-guess how committees choose to manage their business.
The hon. member has asked that I select motions for consideration at report stage because she was not able to debate them in committee. In doing so, she referred to a ruling I gave on December 12, 2012, whereby I noted that I would continue to select motions from independent members at report stage until such time as a satisfactory method was found for them to participate in the clause-by-clause consideration at committee. I understand that the hon. member found unsatisfactory the opportunities afforded to her at the procedure and House affairs committee in relation to Bill C-23. Other members of the committee echoed they too were not satisfied that certain amendments were not debated once the committee's self-imposed deadline was reached. That said, it remains clear to me that the committee considered and voted on all amendments she is asking me to select.
In 2006, Speaker Milliken dealt with a somewhat analogous situation in relation to Bill C-24, the Softwood Lumber Products Export Charge Act.
On November 6, 2006, the hon. member for Burnaby-New Westminster raised a point of order regarding the decision of the Standing Committee on International Trade to limit debate and set a strict deadline by which point debate would end.
Though the situation was different insofar as he was a member of the committee concerned, I believe Speaker Milliken's response, found on page 4756 of Debates, was instructive:
 I do think that committees are masters of their own procedure. They are entitled to make provisions in adopting orders in the committee that govern the way they are going to conduct their business...The committee is allowed to make amendments to the bill. The committee has imposed rules on how those amendments will be dealt with in the committee and how members will be able to address the issues raised by the amendments. It seems to me that [it] is entirely within the jurisdiction of the committee and indeed [it] is [a] quite normal exercise of its powers. 
When the bill was taken up at report stage, the member for Burnaby—New Westminster submitted a large number of the amendments that had been defeated in committee, and asked the Chair to select them on the basis that they had not been debated in committee.
In a ruling I gave as Acting Speaker on November 21, 2006, found on page 5125 of Debates, I declined to do so, reminding the House that:
 ...the Chair selects motions which further amend an amendment adopted by a committee, motions which make consequential changes based on an amendment adopted by a committee and motions which delete a clause. Aside from this, the Chair is loath to select motions unless a member makes a compelling argument for selection based on the exceptional significance of the amendment. 
As far as the Chair is concerned, in keeping with past precedents, I cannot see how the imposition of a deadline for the end of the debate could constitute a justifiable argument for the selection of amendments at report stage that were already presented and defeated in committee.",Conservative,Regina--Qu'Appelle,Andrew Scheer,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=6519cfba-0080-419d-baa9-8ae6e56d032f&Language=E&Section=ALL

4598432,ca.proc.d.2014-05-07.16108.152,2014-05-07,413f63e9-daa1-4444-b83b-c0135109dbba,9240,"Mr. Craig Scott (Toronto—Danforth, NDP)",,Government Orders,Fair Elections Act,Motions in Amendment,"Mr. Speaker, we are at report stage on Bill C-23, and it has been a long odyssey to this point; one of considerable resistance to the bill on the part of the official opposition; many sectors of Canadian society, including organizations who have engaged in the fight, academics and so on; and also, we suspect, considerable pushback from some Conservatives who themselves felt the pressure from the opposition and civil society.
It is worth recapping how we came to be where we are at.
In March 2012, the NDP tabled a motion, which then received unanimous support from everybody in the House, to call on the government to table within six months—that is, by September 2012—a bill that would address the issue of prevention of prosecution of fraudulent election calls and also add to the powers of Elections Canada, including the power of the Chief Electoral Officer to require receipts and documentation for national parties' election expenses, which, believe it or not, currently the Chief Electoral Officer does not have access to.
Well, six months later, by September 2012, a bill with that sort of focus to clearly deal with this kind of fraud and the need to enhance the powers of Elections Canada to investigate had never appeared.
 By October, it was clear the government was not dealing with the priority it had promised to deal with in voting for the motion in March 2012, and so I tabled a private member's bill with a proposed, and I would say very minimal, system of voter contact registry to deal with fraudulent election calls, as well as a couple of provisions that also went to beefing up the penalties for that kind of fraud.
I told the minister at the time, which is prior to the current minister, that this was effectively to just prod the government and also help it to begin thinking about this issue, because it was clearly having trouble meeting its deadline. I said that I was available to consult as needed and also that I expected that the government, with its resources, it would be able to come up with an even more effective system.
Well, by April 2013, we still had not seen a bill, despite any number of times I stood in this House and asked when we might.
Suddenly the former minister announced to all, in a highly organized press conference on a Tuesday in April, that he would be tabling the missing bill two days later, on a Thursday. The next day we heard rumours, which were confirmed on that Thursday, that this announced bill would not be tabled after all. We will never know exactly what revolt occurred in the Conservative caucus to lead to that result, but we do know that there was a revolt, and the then-minister was replaced with the current minister shortly thereafter.
We had to wait almost a full year after that event, to March of this year, for the bill to finally be tabled, two years after the March 2012 motion when the government had agreed that it would be tabling a bill within six months and 18 months after that deadline passed.
All that time was spent coming up with a bill that we have dubbed “the unfair elections act”, which explains why the first motion at this report stage is to delete the title of the bill, which the government has called “the fair elections act”. We can think of no more Orwellian a title. The government has come close to titles that were equally unrepresentative of the actual contents of bills in the past, but this one, frankly, takes the cake.
The fact of the matter is that the bill was tabled and within 18 hours, as the critic for democratic reform, I had to be on my feet, having read, analyzed, and formed first views on a 242-page bill to reply to the minister at the start of second reading.
Within very short order, the House leader was on his feet and gave notice of time allocation; time allocation came very quickly thereafter, and very little debate on second reading was permitted.
We then went into the committee stage, where there was an effort on the part of the official opposition, the NDP, to convince the procedure and House affairs committee to allow for hearings across the country in order to hear what Canadians thought. My colleague from Hamilton Centre put on a strong filibuster in order to convey to the government how serious we were about this, but ultimately, after 10 hours, he had to concede that the arguments had not penetrated the brick wall.
We went on in committee to have 71 witnesses, only one of whom was completely in support of the bill. It was one out of 71. Most of the others were critical of large swaths of the bill, and where they were focusing only on one or two things, they were extremely critical of what it would do. They included the Chief Electoral Officer, the Commissioner of Canada Elections, the previous chief electoral officer and commissioner, the former auditor general, and indeed Preston Manning, and the list goes on.
Then we found ourselves in a clause-by-clause process that ended up having an artificial end date. We had 10 hours of clause by clause, and by the time the guillotine came down at five o'clock last Thursday, we had gotten through only one-fifth of the 242 pages in the bill, one-half of the bill in terms of the clauses, and only half of the opposition amendments. In terms of the amendments that had actually been debated and, after clause-by-clause study, voted on, not a single official opposition amendment was voted in favour of by the government. This was a total farce of a process.
We looked, in a constructive spirit, at the government amendments, voted for those that made sense, tried to amend as it made sense, came up with some proposals that we thought were absolutely impeccable from the government's perspective, and the Conservative members still decided not to vote with us.
For example, when it was clear that the government was not going to allow the Chief Electoral Officer to authorize the use of voter information cards as a second piece of identification, when it was clear that we had lost that fight, we tabled an amendment simply saying that the Chief Electoral Officer had to ensure that the voter information cards were prominently marked with a message to say that this card cannot be used for purposes of identification on voting day, something that was designed to prevent chaos that might occur in 2015 because of the hundreds of thousands who were able to use VICs in 2011. It was the simplest of amendments and the most constructive of amendments.
The government had an entire night to reflect on it, because the amendment was moved at two minutes before closing hour the day before. The government members took overnight, came back, and said they were sorry, they could not vote for that. This was the atmosphere that we worked in.
It has to be said that the efforts of the official opposition and civil society resistance produced some major accomplishments in terms of the government standing down. The fundraising exception that was criticized across the country was removed. The central poll supervisor provision that would allow the first place party in the last election to appoint central poll supervisors was also removed.
Vouching for addresses was restored in the bill because of the pressure that we put on. Retention of documents—some documents, in any case—under the voter contact registry went from one year to three years. Public education by Elections Canada was now permitted for students in schools, even though for everybody else it remains prohibited, and we at least got on record, although the government refused to put this in text in the amendments, that the Chief Electoral Officer will be permitted to communicate freely on any subject that he wishes.
These are major accomplishments, and everyone in Canadian society who pushed back with this effort to resist this attack on our democracy, as Sheila Fraser called it, deserves credit for that. 
Nonetheless, the remaining issues in the bill are huge. The bill is much worse than the current Canada Elections Act. For that reason, we will be voting against the bill and seeking, as much as possible, to move at report stage the few remaining amendments that are available to us as the official opposition.

It is really important that we recognize that the bill is nothing more than a Conservative piece of legislation for which there is no evidence of any form of genuine consultation beyond members of the Conservative caucus, and from what I understand, not even all members of the Conservative caucus were involved. It is in essence being pushed out, from my best guess, from the Prime Minister's Office. 
The Conservatives call it the fair elections act, but it is far from fair.

My question for the member is this: as parliamentarians who love this place and love Westminster parliamentary democracy, what can we do as we watch it consistently reduced, stomped upon, abused, and held in contempt?

Over the next year, it is incumbent on all of us not to allow the Canadian public to forget what the bill is all about and what the struggle to at least make it less terrible than it was when it started was all about. 
Indeed, we cannot afford to have another government in power that acts the way this government does. Apart from reminding Canadians of what the vote will mean in 2015, Canadians also have to join with the NDP and the Green Party in making sure we change the electoral system to a system that embraces proportional representation so that this kind of government, elected with less than 40% of the vote but with more than 50% of the seats, can never again do what it is doing to this institution.

I had the opportunity to study the bill with him in committee. I would like him to provide a brief overview of everything that is still missing in this bill. For example, we did not have the time in committee to debate clauses and amendments concerning all the different things that will affect the Commissioner of Canada Elections, who investigates electoral fraud.

I will answer in English in order to make this as specific as possible. 
It is indeed the case that the Commissioner of Canada Elections is transferred over to the Attorney General's office under the Director of Public Prosecutions. We had no chance to debate that. We had no chance to debate the issue that the Commissioner of Canada Elections would now be dismissible, for cause, by the Director of Public Prosecutions. 
The fact that the voter information cards remain banned is something that we did not succeed on. The fact that the Chief Electoral Officer cannot have access to party receipts for campaigns and the situation with judicial orders to compel witnesses to co-operate in investigations were also not changed.
 As well, public education broadly, beyond students and schools, remains banned, and audio recordings, audio scripts, and phone numbers not only do not have to be conveyed to the CRTC but do not even have to be kept.

It is shameful the way the government has used time allocation to get through its legislative agenda. It is time allocation that takes away the ability of members of Parliament to provide due diligence and provide opinions on important legislation. 
It is not that it is offending individuals such as myself as much as it is Canadians as a whole. I have a responsibility to represent thousands of people in Winnipeg North, and collectively, we represent Canadians all across this land. We are charged with the responsibility to stand in our place and debate legislation. This government, more than any other government in the history of Canada, has used time allocation as a way to prevent members of Parliament from standing in their places to deal with important legislation.
Ironically, this afternoon we are talking about election laws. That is one of the fundamental pillars of our society. Democracy, freedom, rule of law, all of these are very important. In a couple of days we will be paying tribute to our veterans. Why do they go abroad, whether it is World War II, or World War I, or Korea or Afghanistan on peace missions and so forth, and why do we request our military personnel, both today and in the past, to do this? It is to defend our beliefs. Our fundamental freedoms and democracy are important to Canada, to all Canadians.
This is important legislation and the government continues to use its Conservative majority to abuse rights and thereby Canadians in the passage of this legislation. The legislation is fundamentally flawed and should not be passed. The government failed to recognize the need for change.
The government has ignored the advice of Elections Canada's Chief Electoral Officer, former CEOs. In committee we had presentations from individuals like Sheila Fraser. For the first time ever, we had letters that had been signed by 100-plus political scientists from coast to coast to coast in regard to the way in which the government was changing our election laws. It is wrong. 
There is a need for the government, when it changes an election law, to build on a consensus, not the tyranny of a majority to force changes to election laws to fit its needs. That is what we see today a continuation of an abusive majority government that does not recognize the important role we have inside the House of Commons to ensure that the laws we pass are done in due course.
This law does nothing to give the strength, in which Elections Canada and the commissioner wanted, to address the issues that Canadians want addressed. I am referring specifically to the ability to compel witnesses. We have been arguing for this, but more important, Canadians, the Chief Electoral Officer and the Commissioner for Elections Canada want the ability to compel witnesses. It is not something completely unique in federal departments.
More important, from my perspective, there are some provincial entities in Canada of an equivalent nature. Elections Manitoba, for example, already has the ability to compel. Why is the ability to compel so critically important? Just take a look at 2011, whether it is the robocalling, the over-expenditures, thousands of inquiries were made from Canadians from all across this land about issues related to the last federal election.
We need to do what we can to restore public confidence in our election laws at a time when there is a great need to build public confidence based on the last election and the cheating and voter suppression that took place. The way in which to do that is to bring in a law that will have some teeth.
 I was there when the Chief Electoral Officer and the commissioner made their presentations. Canada's election law is getting weaker as a result of the government's failure to address that need in itself.
We have challenged the government to allow for a free vote inside the House of Commons on this bill. We want a free vote on this because we believe that ultimately there might be some Conservatives who believe in democracy more so than the Conservative Party and the attitude in which the government has had toward our election laws. We wanted our committee to travel across Canada to different regions, and the government shut that down.
 The government did not want to go through a genuine debate on amendments. That is why it put in a deadline of May 1, when we saw amendment after amendment being voted on without discussion or debate because the Conservative majority used its majority to prevent that debate from occurring. There was not one amendment that the government passed that was in opposition, unless we take into consideration that it had the same amendment and it was only because the opposition beat it in its submission of it, so it made it a higher priority. The government did not make the amendments that were necessary to make the bill in the best interest of Canada overall.
The government needs to recognize that we have to do more than just change laws based on time allocation and understand and appreciate that there is a process. The Conservative majority government has been abusing its authority in a number of ways. I would suggest that very few are as offensive as what we have before us today. We have a majority government that, without any consensus or genuine consultation, brought in legislation that would change the rules in the next federal election and has failed in building any sort of support.
Everyone who came before committee expressed concern and acknowledged the need for change. Because the government did a bit of tweaking here and there does not justify the disenfranchising that has taken place, the division and the taking out of Elections Canada the Office of the Commissioner, the inability to compel the witnesses, the silencing of Elections Canada—",Liberal,Winnipeg North,Kevin Lamoureux,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=07cf5767-802c-406c-92a7-7dc92af79b40&Language=E&Section=ALL

The answer was that despite the Prime Minister's claims, the economy was not his top priority. The main thing the Prime Minister is focused on is being able to go into the next election and say that he has eliminated the very deficit that he created in 2008 in order to gain votes. 
Because of this, important federal investments are being delayed until after the next election. This is in spite of the fact that action now would generate economic growth and help middle-class families. We saw this when the Prime Minister delayed, for two years, his recently announced funding to help first nations children's education. That is a tremendously important investment when fewer than four in ten young aboriginal students even graduate from high school if they live on reserve.
However, Mr. Harper felt that was not as important as his balanced budget target date. Therefore, the funding does not flow until after the next election. 
The new building Canada fund is no different. It is a 10-year plan, which Liberals were happy to see, but it is heavily back end loaded and extremely light on funding until after the next election. In fact, for the next two years, the fund will have only $210 million of new funding a year. If we compare this with the old building Canada fund commitment for 2013-14, which was $1.7 billion, this has been an 87% cut and it will not be back to last year's level until 2019. That puts projects like the Broadway corridor expansion of SkyTrain at risk. 
Mayor Gregor Robertson of Vancouver held a press conference this week to say that the Broadway corridor expansion of SkyTrain must go forward. However, the federal share of this investment may be delayed many years due to the delay in funding for infrastructure by the Conservative government.
Liberal Party members recently passed a resolution calling for major infrastructure investments of up to 1% of GDP. They understand how critically important infrastructure investment is. 
UBC generates more than $10 billion in economic activity annually, but the bus-clogged Broadway corridor that goes right through my riding of Vancouver Quadra, is a major impediment to investment in the corridor, according to a KPMG report written recently. A new SkyTrain link from Broadway to Commercial would connect jobs and innovation centres in metro Vancouver, making this one of Canada's most important infrastructure and economic corridors. 
As Mayor Gregor Robertson recently said:
 We will see companies from all over the world coming to Vancouver if there’s good connectivity....The cities we compete with globally in technology are well-connected and are invested in rapid transit, and we need to keep pace. So it will have a nationally significant economic impact. 
This expansion just makes good sense. In the short run, the Broadway corridor rapid transit project will create jobs, jobs in construction, transportation and manufacturing. In the long run, public transit in the Broadway corridor will improve the quality of life and of our air, reduce traffic gridlock and stress, shorten commute times and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. It will increase our productivity and make Canada a more attractive place to invest. 
All we need to do is look at the economic benefits of our life sciences and innovation clusters along the Broadway corridor and the important post-secondary institutions, like UBC in Vancouver Quadra, to know that if we act now, we can realize more benefits for greater Vancouver, British Columbia and Canada. Starving the building Canada fund is not the way to do this.",Liberal,Vancouver Quadra,Joyce Murray,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=86fed1de-3861-4448-8242-ad414073ef2e&Language=E&Section=ALL

The investments by our government have been unprecedented, beginning first with the historic building Canada plan in 2007, which invested $33 billion over seven years, followed by the economic action plan in 2009, which invested an additional $14 billion in infrastructure and housing to boost our economy at the time.
A significant portion of this funding has gone to support public transit in cities across the country. Since 2006, we have committed over $7 billion in direct funding to public transit infrastructure across the country. In addition to this, during the same period, Canadian municipalities have used over $2 billion of their federal gas tax fund allocations toward transit investments.
Five of Canada's largest cities, being Toronto, Vancouver, Ottawa, Calgary and Edmonton, have directed most of their federal gas tax fund allocations to the public transit category.
 Following on these record investments, our government worked with provinces, territories and municipalities to develop a long-term plan to invest in public infrastructure. As a result of these efforts, this Conservative government delivered the new building Canada plan, which provides $53 billion for provincial, territorial and municipal infrastructure over a 10 year period. This includes $47 billion in new funding through: the $32.2 billion community improvement fund that supports municipal infrastructure across the country, such as roads, transit, water and waste water systems, and recreational and cultural facilities; the $14 billion new building Canada fund to support provincial, territorial and municipal infrastructure projects of national, regional and local significance, including public transit; and the renewed P3 Canada fund, with $1.25 billion to support innovative ways to invest in infrastructure projects, providing better value for taxpayer money through public-private partnerships.
Our government launched the new building Canada fund on schedule, in fact, ahead of schedule by a few days, on March 28. We are also concluding renewed agreements with provinces and territories for the gas tax fund, which we have extended, doubled, made permanent and now indexed at 2% per year, ensuring municipalities have the certainty they need to plan and invest in their infrastructure priorities.
Finally, $6 billion from existing infrastructure programs continues to support public infrastructure.
In conclusion, our government remains committed to working with the provinces, territories and municipalities as we continue to make record investments in public transit that support job creation, economic growth and a high quality of life for Canadians in every community across Canada.

I note the member is praising the benefits of the gas tax fund, and I would agree with that. This is a program initiated by a previous Liberal government and it was the right thing to do.
He also praises investment in rapid transit.

Over 70% of new funding under the plan is dedicated specifically to municipalities for municipal infrastructure priorities, and this record investment in public infrastructure will build upon the $7 billion our government has already provided for public transit in cities across the country and will support job creation, economic growth and help to enhance a high quality of life for Canadians in every community across Canada.",Conservative,Kitchener--Waterloo,Peter Braid,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=a20523be-cae0-4d31-9595-e9303275e40d&Language=E&Section=ALL

Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.)",,Adjournment Proceedings,National Defence,,"Mr. Speaker, the question I asked in February remains as important today as it was when asked. The use of CSEC to intercept some passengers transiting our major airports for WiFi communications or any other communications constitutes a form of unwarranted surveillance.
I also referenced the 2012-13 annual report of the CSE commissioner, whose mandate is to provide oversight of CSE. In that report, at page 20, the commissioner stated the following with respect to the issue of whether CSE was operating within the law as the minister claims it did in response to my question on February 3. The commissioner stated:
 I had no concern with respect to the majority of the CSEC activities...However, a small number of records suggested the possibility that some activities may have been directed at Canadians, contrary to law...I was unable to reach a definitive conclusion about compliance or non-compliance with the law. 
It is interesting that the Minister of National Defence has failed to address this situation, which flatly contradicts the statement he made to the House on February 3. He said at that point, that report, meaning the 2012-13 report, referring to the commissioner, highlighted that all reviewed CSEC activities were authorized and carried out in accordance with the law. As I just quoted, the commissioner actually said “contrary to law”. 
 What the minister said is factually wrong. I hope the minister or the parliamentary secretary will correct that misleading statement this evening. 
In testimony before the Senate National Security and Defence Committee on February 3, the chief of CSEC, John Foster, stated that CSEC was “specifically required to protect the privacy of Canadians”. However, he also stated that given the nature in the cyber and telecommunications environment, CSEC “may risk the incidental interception of private communications of Canadians”. How often that occurs was not elaborated on. However, Mr. Foster did make a statement that was of concern, and it goes to the heart of the question I asked the Minister of National Defence on February 3. Did the minister, under the provisions of section 273.65 of the National Defence Act, give any authorization to CSEC to conduct surveillance operations which could result in the monitoring of communications of Canadians within Canada or of individuals transiting our country?
Given these revelations and the fact the Minister of Public Safety just this week admitted that the agencies under his mandate were in fact involved in telecommunications surveillance in excess of 1.2 million times in a single year, I have to ask the minister to be clear. Did the minister authorize the surveillance of Canadians under section 273.65 of the National Defence Act?",Liberal,Malpeque,Wayne Easter,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=a76af2a6-7a43-4f8f-a887-0d10b3a0a3c1&Language=E&Section=ALL

The House has engaged in a full debate on this matter, including debating a motion tabled by the member for Malpeque for a full day back in February. The Minister of National Defence and the chief of CSEC have also appeared before the Senate committee and the House committee on national defence to outline how CSEC makes invaluable contributions to the safety of Canadians as well as a continued commitment to lawfulness and privacy.
The key facts continue to remain unchanged. CSEC operates within all Canadian laws, including the National Defence Act, the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the Criminal Code, and the Privacy Act. CSEC is also subject to legislative measures to protect the privacy of Canadians and persons in Canada. By law, CSEC cannot direct its foreign intelligence activities at Canadians, whether they are at home or abroad, or at any person in Canada, and it cannot target Canadians indirectly if it is prohibited from doing it directly, which means it cannot use any of the Five Eyes partners to do any of that work.
CSEC may lawfully assist federal law enforcement and security agencies under their legal authorities, such as applicable court warrants.
CSEC has an effective and independent review body. The CSE Commissioner, an esteemed retired supernumerary judge, reviews all the agency's activities. The commissioner does not take direction from the government or from CSEC, and his office is independently funded by its own budgetary appropriation from Parliament. In order to review the agency's activities, the commissioner is supported by expert staff and external consultants and has full access to CSEC staff, records, and systems.
The commissioner has never found CSEC to have acted unlawfully. In fact, he has specifically noted CSEC's culture of lawful compliance and genuine concern for protecting the privacy of Canadians. Further, multiple commissioners now, all highly qualified judges, have reviewed CSEC's metadata activities. These reviews concluded that its activities are in compliance with the law and subject to comprehensive and satisfactory measures to protect the privacy of all Canadians.
As the current commissioner, Jean-Pierre Plouffe, has noted in his public statements, he is fully aware of CSEC's metadata activities and has the full co-operation of the agency in his review activities.
These are the basic facts, the same as they have been since the member's last request for an adjournment debate back in January. Once again, I would like to take this opportunity to highlight that CSEC's foreign intelligence activities are critical to the ongoing protection of Canadians and Canada's interests. CSEC plays an essential role in protecting our country and our citizens from threats such as terrorism, hostage takers, cyberthreats, and foreign espionage. The work of this agency has revealed plots to attack Canadians and allied personnel overseas before these plans could be executed. CSEC has also helped reveal foreign-led efforts to radicalize and train individuals to carry out attacks here in Canada.
In Afghanistan, CSEC's operations were critical in assisting in the protection of our brave men and women in uniform from insurgents. Each and every day, the dedicated men and women working in the Communications Security Establishment work in obscurity and silence to help ensure our nation's prosperity, security, and stability.",Conservative,Selkirk--Interlake,James Bezan,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=72dace30-741a-4877-8c1c-31b5dc3e4a8e&Language=E&Section=ALL

Tonight's debate is being held under Standing Order 81(4)(a), which provides for each of two sets of estimates selected by the Leader of the Opposition to be considered in committee of the whole for up to four hours.
The debate is also held under the provisions of the order made on Tuesday, May 6, 2014. Tonight's debate is a general one on all of the votes related to Transport. Each member will be allocated 15 minutes. The first round will begin with the official opposition, followed by the government and the Liberal Party. After that, we will follow the usual proportional rotation.
As provided in an order made on Tuesday, May 6, 2014, parties may use each 15-minute slot for speeches or for questions and answers by one or more of their members. In the case of speeches, members of the party to which the period is allotted may speak one after the other. The Chair would appreciate it if the first member speaking in each slot would indicate how his or her time will be used, particularly if it is to be shared.
When the time is to be used for questions and answers, the Chair will expect that the minister's response will reflect approximately the time taken by the question, since this time will be counted in the time originally allotted to the parties.
Though members may speak more than once, the Chair will generally try to ensure that all members wishing to speak are heard before inviting members to speak again, while respecting the proportional party rotations for speakers.
Members need not be in their own seats to be recognized.
Finally, I would remind hon. members that according to the order made May 6, during this evening's debate, no quorum calls, dilatory motions, or requests for unanimous consent shall be received by the Chair.
As your Chair, I am guided by the rules of the committee of the whole and by the order made on Tuesday, May 6, 2014. However, in the interests of a full exchange, I am prepared to exercise discretion and flexibility in the application of these rules.
I also wish to indicate that in committee of the whole, ministers and members should be referred to by their titles or riding names, and of course, all remarks should addressed through the Chair.
I ask for everyone's co-operation in upholding all established standards of decorum, parliamentary language, and behaviour. At the conclusion of tonight's debate, the committee will rise. The estimates related to Transport will be deemed reported, and the House will adjourn immediately until tomorrow.
We may now begin tonight's session. The House, in committee of the whole, pursuant to Standing Order 81(4)(a), the first appointed day, consideration in committee of the whole of all votes related to Transport in the main estimates for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2015.

It is not just a very simple correction that is needed.
First, with respect to Canada Post's five-point action plan that it has embarked on, it has consulted across the country. Canadians have said that they want a postal system they can count on to meet their changing needs, but they also expect it to avoid becoming a drain on their tax dollars.
With respect to the year in review and the service levels that have been achieved by Canada Post, I think it is also important to note that this is the government that put in place the charter that was going to be used in order to measure the ability of Canada Post to respond to what Canadians want and need.
The charter standard was met as follows: 98.8% of Canadian population live within 15 kilometres of a postal outlet; 90.7% live within 5 kilometres; 79.3% live within 2.5 kilometres.",Conservative,Halton,Lisa Raitt,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=b6808e95-1c75-4909-ab86-319d3519016a&Language=E&Section=ALL

Lisa Raitt (Minister of Transport, CPC)",,Government Orders,Business of Supply,"Transport—Main Estimates, 2014–15","Mr. Chair, I appreciate the kind wishes of the hon. member at the beginning, and I appreciate the tough questions he posed. They were very good.
I am pleased to appear before the committee of the whole this evening as part of its review of the votes relating to Transport in the 2014–15 main estimates, but as well to take this opportunity to highlight some of the key priorities that our government is addressing. 
First, I will move to the estimates.
The authorities that we are seeking for the 2014–15 main estimates will be directed to support several key priorities within my department. We will continue to refine and strengthen safety and security oversight of the transportation system. We will continue to contribute to our government's responsible resource development agenda, and we will improve Canada's competitiveness in critical transportation infrastructure. We will ensure that Transport Canada policies, programs, and activities meet the needs of the transportation system in the long term, and we will adopt our government's efficiency and renewal measures.
I will focus the rest of my opening remarks on our efforts to address a few key areas: tanker safety; investments in transportation infrastructures as part of our gateways and corridors strategy; and, of course, rail safety.
First, I will talk about tanker safety and, specifically, what we are doing to strengthen our tanker safety regime. In the main estimates, members will note that we are requesting additional authorities in the amounts of $15.8 million for world-class oil spill response. This is a 686% increase from the authorities that were sought in last year's main estimates. The tanker safety regime is based on three pillars: first, we prevent spills from happening in the first place; second, we clean them up should they happen; third, we hold polluters accountable and financially responsible for those spills. This regime introduced new measures such as increased inspections of foreign tankers in Canadian waters, expanded air surveillance and monitoring of ships in our waters, and a new incident command system to allow the Canadian Coast Guard to respond more effectively to incidents.
 To help achieve a world-class tanker safety system, we struck an independent expert panel led by Captain Gordon Houston, the former CEO of Port Metro Vancouver. The panel submitted its first report in November and it made 45 recommendations on how to strengthen the oil spill preparedness and response regime. We take this advice very seriously. Therefore, we are engaging communities and first nations, the marine industry, and provincial governments on the panel's recommendations. However, the panel's work does continue. It is currently reviewing oil tanker safety measures in the Arctic, as well as marine transport of hazardous and noxious substances. I do expect to receive its second report and its final report later this year.
Recently when I was in British Columbia, I was able to be on board one of the planes operated by our national aerial surveillance program, or NASP. It was quite an experience because I had the opportunity to appreciate not only the importance of the efforts but also the excitement of the members of the crew in their everyday work, because they are working hard on a world-class tanker safety regime. We are going to double the funding for this aerial surveillance program, and that is going to allow this team to increase the number of hours the planes are in the air, and then they can better monitor our coasts and ultimately deter potential polluters, and catch a spill before it becomes too big.
Economic action plan 2014 recognizes the importance of trade and investment to Canada's economic future, and the role of Canada's transportation infrastructure network in supporting trade in domestic and international markets. Through the main estimates, we are seeking $702 million to support important infrastructure projects through the gateways and corridors funding program. The program supports international trade with the United States and other key partners by ensuring integrated and efficient transportation systems across all modes. We have to work with other levels of government and private-sector stakeholders, and together we are both investing in important infrastructure products at border crossings and bolstering our efforts to coordinate infrastructure planning as part of government's beyond the border initiative. Improvements to cross-border trade will go a long way toward ensuring continued economic growth for Canada.
Finally, I would like to turn my attention to what my top priority is, and that is strengthening rail safety in this country.
This past January, the Transportation Safety Board released three interim recommendations regarding its ongoing investigation into the Lac-Mégantic train derailment. The recommendations addressed three factors: the vulnerabilities of the DOT-111 tank cars used to transport crude oil, the need for emergency response assistance plans, or ERAPs, along routes where large volumes of liquid hydrocarbons are shipped, and the requirement for route planning and analysis for trains carrying dangerous goods.
On April 23, we provided our response and we outlined our actions going forward to directly and decisively address these recommendations. The Government of Canada is committed to continued collaboration with industry, other levels of government, and various stakeholders.
Well before the events at Lac-Mégantic, rail safety issues were already being addressed by our government. In May of last year, amendments to the Railway Safety Act came into force that strengthen the safety requirements for rail companies in Canada. 
As well, we have worked for years to maintain safety for pedestrians and vehicles around grade crossings. New safety regulations were recently published, and this year the federal government's grade crossing improvement program is providing more $9 million to improve safety at over 600 railway crossings in this country.
 I also feel strongly in this case that Canadians should not be expected to cover the costs of damages. To this end, Transport Canada has consulted stakeholders on how to strengthen the existing liability and compensation regime for rail. This way, in the event of an accident, sufficient resources would be available to adequately compensate victims, pay for cleanup costs, and protect taxpayer funds. This complements recent consultations by the Canadian Transportation Agency into the insurance coverage it requires of federally regulated railway companies when they issue certificates of fitness to the companies.
When it comes to addressing the recommendations from the Transportation Safety Board, I want to stress that we are committed to improving railway safety and the transportation of dangerous goods by rail. 
Following the accident in Lac-Mégantic, the federal government took immediate action. The measures I announced in April build upon this work and further strengthen our country's regulation and oversight of rail safety in the transportation of dangerous goods. I will just remind the House of these measures.
We first acted to remove the least crash-resistant DOT-111 tank cars from dangerous goods service in general by directing the phase-out of tank cars that have no continuous reinforcement of their bottom shell. There are about 5,000 of these cars in North America.
We are also improving the tank cars that are used to transport crude oil or ethanol to significantly reduce the risk of these substances escaping if the cars are involved in an accident. In January of this year, Transport Canada published a revised mandatory standard for consultation, requiring thicker steel, head shields, and top-fitting protection. All DOT-111 tank cars that do not meet this January 2014 standard must be phased out or refitted within three years if they are to be used for the transportation of crude oil or ethanol.
We will also implement even more stringent tank car requirements in the future, based upon industry recommendations and technical discussions that are ongoing with the United States. In fact, Canada is already committed to meeting or exceeding all U.S. requirements for DOT-111 tank cars.
The second Transportation Safety Board recommendation that we are addressing is in relation to emergency response assistance plans. These are formal plans that describe what industry will do to support first responders in the event of an accident involving dangerous goods that require special expertise and response equipment.
To ensure we are prepared in the event of a rail accident, the federal government will require rail shippers to develop emergency response plans for higher-risk flammable liquids. In the event of an accident involving significant quantities of these dangerous goods, approved response plans will give first responders access in a timely manner to the resources and the assistance that they need. To accomplish this, we have issued a direction to require shippers to develop emergency response assistance plans for crude oil, gasoline, diesel, aviation fuel, and ethanol when even a single tank car is loaded with one of these designated flammable liquids.
We will also establish a task force with key partners and stakeholders such as the Canadian Association of Fire Chiefs and the Aboriginal Firefighters' Association as well as key response, shipping, and railway representatives. This task force will provide a dedicated and collaborative forum to enhance coordination of response capability. We will also consider expanding response plan requirements for other class 3 flammable liquids after reviewing the matter with this task force.
Finally, Canada already has a strong regulatory regime for trains travelling in both rural and urban areas. Transport Canada has now introduced even stricter requirements for trains transporting dangerous goods in order to safeguard communities along our railway lines. 
We issued an emergency directive requiring railway companies to immediately slow trains that transport dangerous goods and implement other key operating practices that respond to the TSB's recommendations. The emergency directive adapts the recently announced U.S. voluntary requirements to the Canadian rail network, requiring companies to make key operational changes quickly.
We will make these requirements permanent by issuing a ministerial order that requires railway companies transporting dangerous goods to develop new rules on these operating practices. It is a major undertaking that requires careful planning in order to deliver rapid and concrete results.
In conclusion, the initiatives I have outlined today demonstrate clearly how our government is working to maintain transportation in Canada that is safe, secure, efficient, and environmentally responsible, and we take this responsibility seriously.",Conservative,Halton,Lisa Raitt,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=b6808e95-1c75-4909-ab86-319d3519016a&Language=E&Section=ALL

In reviewing the independent Transportation Safety Board's statistics over the last few years with respect to rail occurrences, two of the most persistent areas for difficulties remain trespasser and crossing accidents, including fatalities.

With respect to grade crossings, we have a fund available to help with making changes at grade crossings, as I referred to in my remarks already. We also have a program to close grade crossings, either private or public, that are no longer needed. We contribute to that as well. There are about 5,000 of these in the country.
With respect to Operation Lifesaver, it is absolutely worth taking time to talk about a great group of people who work together to ensure that we are communicating with kids, with families, and with communities about the importance of safety around rail. In fact, last week was rail safety week, and Operation Lifesaver has done a great job tweeting out information to people to make sure they have rail safety at the forefront of their minds.
In March of this year, I was able to host a round table dealing specifically with the issues associated with higher density in certain urban areas and pedestrian fatalities as a result of accidents with rail. We brought together the main railways: GO Transit, VIA, CN, and CP. We also brought into the room a mom who lost her son. Those kinds of conversations are important in reminding ourselves that we should continuously talk about not just the transportation of dangerous goods but also the fact that we do have this interaction with pedestrians in communities and that we should continuously do all we can to ensure their safety.

I would like to take the minister to Bill C-30, the issue of grain transportation in western Canada and the horrendous backlog of grain transport this last year.

If that is the carry-over on top of even a normal crop in western Canada this summer, the industry will be facing much the same challenge this year as it faced last year. It will be a huge problem for a great many farmers.

However, we cannot forget or deny the fact that this has been a bumper crop year. We have seen an increase of over 33% over previous years. We had anticipated there would be a higher carry-out if it continued along at the same level.

Even more important is preplanning.

For example, one of the most discriminated against areas is the central part of Saskatchewan that wants to move a significant volume of grain south into the United States. However, the railways would prefer to move it east or west, and so they favour Alberta and shippers in Manitoba. The central corridor of Saskatchewan moving south is finding it very difficult to move grain, as well as producer cars and short-line rail operators.
What is the government prepared to do now to ensure equity among those various corridors?",Liberal,Wascana,Ralph Goodale,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=1a1a9dee-c228-40fc-b926-42f8441d84f0&Language=E&Section=ALL

We have a commodity supply chain table that Transport Canada is facilitating to have these kinds of discussions about the chains. 
We took it very seriously when we set the actual tonnage level that we expected the railways to move. It was done so in contemplation that all corridors would be moved, and the numbers chosen actually reflected that maximum amounts of grain had moved through those corridors on a historical basis. As such, we knew that we would be pushing the railways in terms of how much they could carry, and indeed they have fulfilled their marks we have set out for them.
In moving forward, we are going to be looking more closely, through the review of the Canada Transportation Act, at the importance of ensuring that the chain is robust, it can adapt to differences and that we attract investment into this chain over the long term.

I just could not wait to get started on this wonderful speech that I have for the House. It gives me a chance to offer congratulations on the minister's birthday a second time, so that is a good thing.
As I started out to say, I want to talk about Canada Post but I want to acknowledge at the outset that it is an arm's-length crown corporation.
First, let me deal with the financial situation at Canada Post. It is undeniable that the business of delivering mail has evolved at a remarkable rate, especially with the incredible popularity of electronic mail. But whether we talk about individuals, business, or governments, everybody has to live within their means. This is as true of me and my family as it is of the government or of Canada Post. Canadian families know they cannot continually spend more than they earn. Business and governments are no different. Canada Post will not receive government subsidies to operate in an unprofitable fashion. It must adapt, as we all have to. 
That said, the throne speech highlighted our government's unwavering commitment to control spending while investing in Canadians' priorities to safeguard our economy. Year after year in budget after budget, we have put in place credible plans to achieve financial sustainability and set clear targets to bring our deficit down.
This was crucial as we dealt with the damaging effects of a worldwide recession, one of the worst in more than seven decades. We had to get our fiscal house in order to keep Canadians working and our economy growing. The proof of this commitment is in the results. I remind the House that one of minister Flaherty's greatest legacies will be a balanced budget in 2015.
More than just managing debt, our government is tackling spending. We are reducing the size and the cost of government to ensure taxpayers get good value for money. We are working hard to make government more efficient and responsive to the needs of Canadians. This is because of our overreaching goal to create the conditions for jobs, economic growth, and long-term prosperity for all Canadians.
We are the envy of the world. Three credit rating agencies, Moody's, Fitch, and Standard &amp; Poor's, have reaffirmed their top ratings for Canada. Both the International Monetary Fund and the OECD expect Canada to be among the strongest growing economies in the G7 this year and next.
Reducing spending, lowering taxes, and paying down debt are enabling us to seize new economic opportunities as we promote free trade and innovation, the keys to job creation, economic growth, and prosperity. I lay out these facts to underline that these same truths apply just as much to Canada Post as it faces unprecedented challenges.
One need not be a learned scholar to judge the trends in the fiscal forecast of Canada Post to see where the trend leads. A 2013 report prepared by The Conference Board of Canada into the corporation's future projects that unless major changes are made, annual operating deficits will reach nearly $1 billion by 2020, that is $1 billion per year. That is certainly a deficit that requires significant and immediate attention.
While many Canadians will admit they use mail less and less, some are quick to point out the popularity of parcel delivery. Could this not be a promising area of business growth, they ask? Absolutely it can. The parcel market is increasing as more and more Canadians are making online purchases. E-commerce helped parcel volumes grow by about two million pieces in the first nine months of 2013 compared to the year earlier. Canada Post parcel revenue was up 11.2%, which amounts to $32 million from the third quarter of 2012. However, I believe the minister could confirm that parcel revenues are simply not enough to compensate for mail volume declines. 
Consider that in 2012, total transaction mail revenue amounted to $3 billion or 51% of the corporation's operating revenues. Parcels on the other hand accounted for less than $1.3 billion or 22% of operating revenues. Even though parcel volume is projected to increase by 26% by 2020, it will not be enough to get Canada Post out of the red. 
Quite simply, the corporation's current business model no longer allows it to earn sufficient revenues to offset its cost. Without changes, the future viability of the postal service is in question.
As the minister has highlighted in this place many times before, the challenges of Canada Post have arisen in part because of the global recession. The pace of postal decline has been accelerating in Canada and other developed countries for a number of years. However, it has accelerated after the global recession began in 2008.
Companies cut their mailing costs as part of overall cost reductions. Many opted to ship more billing statements and marketing online. At the same time, individual consumers began moving en masse from traditional to digital communications. Canadians are now more likely to send a text message or an email than to take the time to write a letter, post it and wait several days to be delivered.
As the minister has noted many times, mail volumes per address have dropped by nearly 25% between 2008 and 2012. In fact, more than one billion fewer pieces of letter mail were sent last year than in 2006.
The U.S. Postal Service has reduced service hours and the number of employees to address financial pressures, for instance, while the U.K. has privatized and significantly increased stamp prices. Not to mention, neither of these countries presents the same unique challenges that our northern communities presents.
The digital economy is not going away. Canada Post has no option but to find new ways of doing business to keep its operation sustainable. Canada Post must manage its business prudently. It has no choice. It has a mandate to operate on a self-sustaining financial basis. Financial responsibility is a legislated obligation.
The services currently provided by Canada Post are clearly no longer affordable. The corporation needs to spend within its means in the same way that individuals do as they manage their family budgets. More than that, change is essential if Canada Post is to keep pace with the choices Canadians are already making about the way they prefer to communicate.
Since delivery accounts for about 40% of Canada Post's operation costs, it is the most obvious place to start.
Door-to-door delivery is by far the most expensive mode of delivery. It costs between two and three times what it costs to deliver to a community mailbox. Compare $283 annually for home delivery versus $108 for community mailboxes. They are also cheaper than delivering to a rural mailbox, which rings in at $179 per year.
To be clear, we are talking about changes affecting only home delivery. Businesses with large volumes of mail or located in business zones will generally retain their door-to-door delivery. However, the remaining one-third of Canadians still will have door-to-door service. The minority of people in our country, I would add and I am one of them, will gradually shift over the next five years to community mailboxes instead. Community mailboxes provide secure mail storage in a convenient place close to home to receive parcels and packages.
Remember that Canada Post introduced community mailboxes back in 1981, so it has been successfully delivering mail and packages this way for a very long time.
The corporation is expected to reduce its workforce by between 6,000 and 8,000 positions by 2019 and this will be achieved largely through attrition, which will help reduce its overhead dramatically. Like most workplaces populated by baby boomers, many will leave the workforce in a few years' time.
In closing, I have a question that I would like to pose for the minister. I hate to present her with such a tough question, but although it is tough, it is fair. I was hoping that the minister would inform the House on the current crisis facing Canada Post and the government's commitment to ensuring that it does not become a burden on taxpayers, because the taxpayers are up to here with unnecessary costs.

Lisa Raitt (Minister of Transport, CPC)",,Government Orders,Business of Supply,"Transport—Main Estimates, 2014–15","Mr. Chair, I thank the hon. member for his insight into a topic that we certainly must understand better.
In 1981, Canada Post was set up as a crown corporation. In its documents, it was done so to ensure that postal services, financial security and independence continued. That is exactly what we are trying to do today by accepting Canada Post's five-point plan for moving into the future.
The reality is twofold. First, Canada Post has to actually deliver to more mailboxes or to more addresses than before. It is increased by 1.2 million. Second, Canada Post, as well, is delivering fewer letters. In fact, most Canadian families only buy two stamps a month. That is significant.
It is clear that the five-point plan is something Canada Post has researched, has consulted on, has studied and has indicated is its best path forward for achieving financial self-sustainability along with the continued service provision that it needs to do.
I appreciated the words of my hon. friend when he talked about the costs associated with community mailboxes. In terms of trying to ensure that we have a delivery system that is efficient and cost-effective, it is important to note that the door-to-door service to one-third of Canadian households is $298 on an average annual cost per address. However, delivering to a community mailbox is $113 on an annual cost per address basis.
 That is a significant savings. It is one of those kinds of savings that Canada Post has looked at to ensure Canadians will continue to receive mail on a daily basis, which is what it said it wanted to do. At the same time, what it also said was it wanted to ensure it was not relying upon taxpayer dollars. That is what Canada Post is attempting to achieve.",Conservative,Halton,Lisa Raitt,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=b6808e95-1c75-4909-ab86-319d3519016a&Language=E&Section=ALL

Lisa Raitt,Interjection,Government Orders,Business of Supply,"Transport—Main Estimates, 2014–15","Mr. Chair, I can only refer to the news release that Canada Post has put out, because it is its five-point plan. What it says in the title is that the plan will return system to financial sustainability by 2019 and ensure continued role of enabling trade and commerce.
It is looking at areas of growth. The hon. member mentioned those, and one of them, of course, was parcel delivery. As indicated, with the increase in the amount of addresses Canada Post has to deliver to and the lack of letter mail that is delivered, it does have to do other things.
In its five-point plan, it lays out certain things it would like to do. The main initiatives are these: over the next five years, convert the remaining one-third of Canadian households that receive their mail at the door to community mailbox delivery; that it has a new approach to pricing letter mail to take effect, which has happened; that it expands convenience through postal franchisees; that it streamlines it operations; and that it does address the cost of labour.
As was pointed out by the hon. member, it is worthy to note that the average age of a current employee of Canada Post is 48 years old, almost my age today. Canada Post expects that nearly 15,000 employees will retire or leave the company over the next 5 years. That is more enough, in its view, to allow for the reduction of between 6,000 and 8,000 positions, mainly through attrition.

In December last year, Canada Post Corporation released a comprehensive five-point action plan entitled “Ready for the Future”. It was designed to realign how it delivers and prices postal services to meet Canadians' emerging and future needs while substantially reducing costs to the taxpayer.
This is a watershed moment for Canada's national postal service. Letter mail volumes have been declining since 2006, when Canada Post delivered 1.2 billion more letters than it did in 2013. That is a big number. The corporation estimates that for every 1% drop in mail volume, it loses $30 million in revenue. This is placing a huge strain on Canada Post's finances, as witnessed by losses of $129 million, before tax, in the postal segment alone in the third quarter of fiscal year 2013. It is quite clear that the services, as currently provided by Canada Post, are no longer sustainable.
Canada Post must now manage its business as a viable commercial enterprise that competes effectively in every product line. Even its traditional direct marketing business is facing digital rivals that use mobile and smart technologies, and the parcel business operates in a highly competitive environment. 
The corporation is well aware that to build on recent successes, it must attract customers in an increasingly complex economic environment. The parcel business, unlike letter mail, is highly competitive, and parcel volumes have been rising worldwide. Postal services in many countries have been aggressively using their extensive sorting and delivery infrastructure to expand in this sector. Globalization has more parcels coming into Canada to be processed to the same high standards, and the highly competitive parcel delivery market means that service providers must modify operations in order to win and retain customers with the quality and reliability of their service. In the business of the customer parcel delivery market, that means providing fast, reliable, and convenient delivery, excellent tracking options, and reasonable prices. 
The growth in the parcel industry has also intensified local and global competition. FedEx and UPS, for example, have increased their competitive positions in Canada. Customer patterns have also shifted from premium to less urgent products that cost less. The increased competitive landscape has put increased pressure on Canada Post to manage costs, improve product offerings, and provide a superior customer experience. 
With approximately 40% of parcel deliveries to Canada originating internationally, Canada Post has negotiated bilateral agreements, notably with the United States and China, to increase its share of this inbound traffic. The corporation has also made extensive investments in new facilities, including a 700,000 square foot plant at Vancouver International Airport. It has increased real-time tracking through portable scanners for employees and has added to its capacity for motorized delivery to handle growing package volumes. 
Canada Post also offered on-demand parcel pickup for small businesses in 2011 and 2012. It provided enhanced web services for online retailers, including seamless management of returns. 
I wish to emphasize that the government is committed to ensuring transparency in how Canada Post provides quality postal service to all Canadians, rural and urban, individuals and businesses, in a secure and financially self-sustaining manner. That is why the government established the Canadian postal service charter in 2009, which set out its expectations regarding Canada Post service standards and related activities in providing postal services that meet the needs of Canadians.
An important aspect of the postal service charter is its commitment to universal service that ensures that Canadians in both urban and rural areas can send and receive letter mail and parcels within Canada and between Canada and elsewhere. As part of Canada Post's continued commitment to parcel delivery, parcel services to Canadians living in rural and northern communities not currently serviced by competing parcel delivery companies will have significantly wider access to, and the ability to return products from, Canada and around the world.This is crucial for the many rural and northern communities not currently served by private sector courier companies. 
Canada Post's five-point action plan embraces the principle of reform without seeking any change to the Canadian Postal Service Charter. This plan is about giving Canadians the postal service they need in the emerging digital economy. Canada Post is quite aware of the changing face of the postal industry and has been preparing for a future with less mail and more parcels for a number of years.
The corporation has implemented measures to expand its parcel volume both through its postal operations and through its Purolator courier service. For example, changes to internal operations first begun in 2010 have made for a more efficient flow of parcels through the network to the customer. Canada Post has launched an aggressive plan to invest in replacing its aging processing infrastructure and delivery processes with more modern and cost-effective approaches driven by technology. The sorting equipment in place today is much faster and more accurate. From a delivery perspective, it has meant a massive shift toward motorization. 
Canada Post will continue to leverage these investments. Doing so will further reduce the cost of processing the mail and will allow the company to better serve the growing parcel market and provide the services Canadians will need in the future.
In many urban areas, Canada Post has moved away from letter carriers delivering mail by foot to carriers who leave their depot every morning with a fuel-efficient van containing the mail and parcels for delivery on their route. Putting mail and parcels in one truck for delivery provides a better end-customer experience, especially in the parcel business, at a much lower cost to the corporation. These improvements will allow Canada Post to compete more effectively in the fast-paced and technology-driven global parcel market. All kinds of parcels are now flowing through Canada Post sorting plants, including items that depend on fast and accurate delivery, from health care products and gourmet food to live bees and baby chicks.
Canada Post realizes that the parcel business is highly competitive and it does not have the exclusive privilege to deliver parcels, as it does for letters. Therefore, the corporation has focused on providing a superior customer experience, recognizing the attachment Canadians have to their parcels. Canada Post has indicated a desire to expand en-route pickups and launch a comprehensive returns solution that will benefit e-commerce merchants and shoppers by improving inventory management, returns processes, and automatic billing.
An important component of Canada Post's proposed strategy is its intention to build upon its current strength in parcel delivery, which has demonstrated growth over the past few years thanks in large measure to the fast-growing market of online shoppers.
It is clear that Canadians have become enthusiastic online consumers. Statistics Canada reported in October 2012 that the value of orders placed online by Canadians reached $18.9 billion in 2012, up 24% from 2010 when the survey was last conducted. That is 24% in two years. More than half of Internet users, 56%, ordered goods or services online in 2012. Perhaps even more encouraging, most Internet shoppers, 82%, had placed an order from a company in Canada.
Canada Post's parcels line of business currently offers a range of domestic and international delivery services and is the largest player in the Canadian parcel market, with more than 50% market share. The corporation sees an unprecedented opportunity for additional growth linked to e-commerce as online business activity increases. Customers for parcel services include businesses, consumers of all sizes, governments, international postal administrations, and other delivery companies. 
According to a recent report by the Conference Board of Canada, residential and small business customers indicated that their demand for parcel service will continue to rise with the spread of e-commerce.
Parcels are the fastest-growing line of service in the core Canada Post business. The corporation reports that overall growth in parcel volumes experienced a record-breaking holiday season, which runs between November 11 and January 4. Canada Post delivered 30 million parcels during this period, which was five million more than the holiday season last year. The corporation delivered more than one million parcels in a day, on 10 different days. Weekend delivery was also very successful. Canada Post employees delivered a total of 1.1 million parcels over the six weekends of the holiday season, with the highest number of deliveries occurring on the December 21–22 weekend. That is 317,000 deliveries.
The main reason behind this growth is that parcels are the one postal product that has seen growth driven by the digital revolution. Canada Post advises that its top-25 retail customers are making major e-commerce gains. January parcel volumes from these retailers shot up 35% compared to January of last year. This dramatic increase follows a highly successful holiday season in which year-over-year parcel volumes from this top-performing group grew by 50%.
It is very obvious that things and times change. They have certainly changed at Canada Post, and it has tried to adapt.
I have a question for the minister. The opposition is refusing to see that Canada Post is facing a new digital reality. Can the minister please explain why the status quo was not a possible solution to Canada Post's financial situation?",Conservative,Bruce--Grey--Owen Sound,Larry Miller,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=d5a197ec-6694-4a63-b918-f7c55df7b7c2&Language=E&Section=ALL

I would invite those who have not taken a look at it, incontrovertible facts that are located within the Canada Post Corporation's 2013 annual report about the status-quo approach. Its plan includes how they plan on dealing with some realities. I thought I would quote from Canada Post, since it is an arm's-length Crown corporation that is responsible for its own operations, to give its perspective on why it came up with the five-point plan that we have accepted. 
This is what it said:
 …households and businesses have moved away from mail as a primary source of communication. They freely use electronic means to send and receive their mail. As a result, in the digital economy, Canada Post's exclusive privilege to deliver letters no longer adequately funds what’s called the universal service obligation.… 
 Transaction Mail volumes per address have dropped 30 per cent since 2007. Less mail equals less revenue, while the costs of providing postal service are largely fixed. 
 In 2013, we delivered 1.2 billion fewer pieces of Domestic Lettermail™ than we did in 2006, putting at risk a service to Canadians that has existed for longer than Canada has been independent. 
 Our challenge was to put forward a plan that balances the needs of all Canadians, while addressing the legacy costs of a system built mainly to process and deliver a large volume of mail. Reducing our cost of operations in many ways has helped, but we had to do much more to reshape the postal system and avoid chronic financial losses. 
 With that certainty, we announced our Five-Point Action Plan in late 2013 to build the foundation of a new postal system for Canadians. It reflects what we heard from people across the country as we talked about the future of the postal service in towns, cities and online. Canadians want a postal system they can count on to meet their changing needs, but they also expect it to avoid becoming a drain on their tax dollars. 
 It’s the result of two years of analyzing all options, including those at post offices around the world, to determine what would work best for Canadians. We’re streamlining our operations, addressing the cost of labour, adjusting our pricing to better reflect today's environment, expanding convenience through franchise post offices and moving the remaining five million door-to-door customers to community mail box delivery. This comprehensive five-year plan will return Canada Post to solid financial footing and provide a platform for growth fuelled by the changing needs of the people and businesses we serve. 
Clearly, Canada Post has put a lot of thought, effort, study, and insight into what its five-point plan will be as we are dealing with the realities of the digital economy.

This evening I would like to speak about Canadian ports, specifically the Port Metro Vancouver, and the benefits the port brings to the Canadian economy.
The 18 port authorities that comprise Canada's port system are central to Canada's economic activity. These port authorities handle a significant amount of Canadian trade, approximately 310 million tons of cargo valued at more than $162 billion annually. On the whole, Canadian port authorities contribute about $24.5 billion to the Canadian gross domestic product and provide almost 269,000 jobs for Canadians.
 Port Metro Vancouver is the largest and most diversified port in Canada. It is also the fourth-largest tonnage port in North America. In short, the port is a major economic force that facilitates trade between Canada and more than 160 world economies, and handles 19% of Canada's total trade. The operation of Port Metro Vancouver is complex, and it is key to Canada's overall supply chain. The port's operations involve many different enterprises, including cargo terminals, cruise terminals, shipyards, railways, trucks, and shipping agents. In addition to facilitating trade, one of the most significant economic benefits the port provides is direct and indirect employment, not just for British Columbia but for other provinces as far away as our own home province of Ontario.
A recent study of the economic impact of Port Metro Vancouver showed that its ongoing operations support 38,200 direct jobs in British Columbia. The direct impact of this employment on British Columbia's economy is estimated at $3.5 billion in gross domestic product, $8.5 billion in economic output, and $2.3 billion in wages. The indirect impacts of the port's operations on businesses in British Columbia are even more impressive: 76,800 jobs; $6.7 billion in gross domestic product; $14.5 billion in economic output; and $4.6 billion in wages. These indirect impacts include tourism revenues related to cruise-ship passengers.
The majority of direct employment generated by the operations of Port Metro Vancouver is located within the lower mainland area. However, there are also close to 10,100 off-site jobs supported by the economic activity of Port Metro Vancouver. This off-site employment represents about 22% of total direct Port Metro Vancouver businesses' employment and reaches through western Canada and beyond. Outside of British Columbia, the largest direct employment impact is in Alberta, followed by Ontario. This includes supporting 2,700 direct jobs in Alberta and 1,600 direct jobs in Ontario. Members can see the vital role that Port Metro Vancouver plays in securing our country's long-term prosperity.
For those who do not know, Port Metro Vancouver operates across five business sectors: automobiles, breakbulk, bulk, containers, and cruise. Based on data from 2013, Port Metro Vancouver handled 135 million tons of cargo, a record for the port, with an overall increase of 9% over 2012. Import and export tonnage maintained balanced growth, each showing a 9% increase.
The port is leveraging the strong performance with significant capital investment intended to further increase its competitiveness. This investment will further contribute to the port's economic impact on the regional and national economies.
By 2022, Port Metro Vancouver has identified $1.4 billion in capital investment to further increase its performance. This additional economic activity is generated by expenditures associated with Port Metro Vancouver's current capital program and by the capital investments of Port Metro Vancouver's tenants. Together, in pursuing this capital investment plan, Port Metro Vancouver and Port Metro Vancouver tenants will create an estimated total of 2,800 direct person-years annually, with a potential total impact of 6,100 person-years of employment.
As others have noted in this place before, our government has worked to improve supply chain efficiency, reliability, and security so that Canada stays competitive in the continuously evolving world of global commerce. For example, we launched the Asia-Pacific gateway and corridor initiative and, to date, we have invested $1.4 billion in Asia-Pacific gateway projects in partnership with all four western provinces, municipalities, and the private sector. Many of these projects form a critical portion of a supply chain that also includes Port Metro Vancouver.
Furthermore, under the Prime Minister's leadership, our government is making unprecedented investments in infrastructure, solidifying a pivotal base in much of our transportation network through, of course, our new building Canada plan. Key transportation assets, including port infrastructure, will be eligible for funding under the $4-billion national infrastructure component of the plan, which is earmarked for projects of national significance.
Given that efficient and reliable operations at Port Metro Vancouver are critical to Canada's Asia-Pacific gateway and the national economy, the Government of Canada recently took action to support the resumption of trucking operations at Port Metro Vancouver. The estimated economic losses to Canada during the recent work stoppage were estimated at $126,000 per day. We found this unacceptable and acted quickly to develop a joint action plan in conjunction with the Province of British Columbia and Port Metro Vancouver to bring stability to the container trucking industry. The plan contains 15 points for implementation and provides a framework for long-term stability in the container trucking industry. All parties are working together to implement the plan with input from key stakeholders.
Our government is committing to removing roadblocks to prosperity, which is why we acted quickly to bring stability to the industry, diminish wait times, and prevent disruptions in the future. For example, the Government of Canada brought in new regulations to increase the rates paid to truckers at Port Metro Vancouver.
As you know, Mr. Chair, our government's focus is to create jobs, growth, and long-term prosperity for all Canadians, but we cannot achieve these goals on our own. Port Metro Vancouver is Canada's largest and most diversified port, remains critical to our national transportation and trade system, and it could not be clearer that our government is committed to ensuring the reliability of Canada's Asia-Pacific gateway and the economic well-being of this great country.
As I conclude, I have an important question for the minister. Given the topic of much of my remarks, could the minister please update the House on our government's various actions with respect to the recent situation at Port Metro Vancouver?",Conservative,Kitchener--Waterloo,Peter Braid,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=a20523be-cae0-4d31-9595-e9303275e40d&Language=E&Section=ALL

Lisa Raitt,Interjection,Government Orders,Business of Supply,"Transport—Main Estimates, 2014–15","Mr. Chair, as the hon. member has indicated, Port Metro Vancouver is absolutely critical to Canada's Asia-Pacific gateway. We have invested heavily in the Asia-Pacific gateway and it has been a great success. As we open up more markets through our unprecedented free trade deals, as we continue to responsibly develop our vast resources, we need to have a way to move these resources to that market and the Asia-Pacific gateway has been a stellar success.
Port Metro Vancouver is an important part of it. The port handled $172 billion worth of cargo in 2013, a total number of jobs 100,000, with 38 million metric tonnes of coal or 40% of the total black cargo in 2013. These are all important things.
The specific question with respect to the trucks and the containers is one that is of great importance to us. It all commenced in February of this year with a protest that started on port property. We acted very quickly. We appointed Vince Ready to ensure that an independent review that was directed at resolving the concerns of truckers and stakeholders was undertaken.
We joined with the Province of British Columbia and Port Metro Vancouver soon after that to announce our action plan. An agreement on that action plan was reached between the governments of Canada and B.C., Port Metro Vancouver, and members of the United Truckers Association and Unifor in order to end that work disruption at Port Metro Vancouver in order to get to full operation. The port is at full operation.
Almost immediately the steering committee started meeting in order to ensure that the joint action plan was carried out. Meetings have been continuing on a weekly basis ever since. The obligations the federal government said it would undertake in this joint action plan have been carried out or are in the process of being carried out as we speak.
Most importantly, on May 2 of this year I announced with the Province of B.C. and Port Metro Vancouver joint funding for an expedited initiative to outfit the remainder of the container truck fleet approved to serve port terminals as part of Metro Vancouver's truck licensing system with GPS technology. This is the kind of implementation that is expedited and needed because it represents one point of the progress in the joint action plan.
We will continue to work. I will be meeting with Minister Stone on the topic.

In doing so, a number of strong actions were taken. One of them was moving out of the Canadian ports corporation and into these free-standing, independent, self-financed, self-regulated port authorities, and it has been an incredible success when we look at what has been accomplished in moving to that model. We have seen an increase in productivity in the transportation sector of over 30%. Those are real and important gains to ensure efficiency in our transportation system that gives us that global competitive edge.
The ports are an integral part of our transportation sector, whether in St. John's, Newfoundland, Port Metro Vancouver, or Prince Rupert. They all listen to their local communities' needs and their wants in order to balance the economic and community benefits that they bring. Their focus, however, is on marine shipping and they continue to stay at the cutting edge of what is important.

I can say this. In the operation of key trains, which includes even a single tank car of crude oil in this specific instance, we do demand that a risk assessment be taken into consideration. That would be carried out in consultation with the Federation of Canadian Municipalities to make sure that they are doing what they can and have all the operating procedures to keep the train on the tracks as part of their operation.

Our government understands the importance of transportation to Canada's economy. Marine transportation, in particular, plays a significant role in our ability to trade with international partners and to ship goods around the world. At a time when global trade and connectedness are increasingly necessary for economic growth, it is essential that marine activities be carried out safely and in an environmentally sound way.
This evening I would like to highlight Transport Canada's marine safety programs by providing a brief overview of their scope and purpose. These programs directly support the department's mandate for safe transportation as well as the Government of Canada's priority of having safe and secure communities. 
Marine safety programs establish regulatory requirements that are harmonized with international standards for the safe and environmentally responsible operation of vessels in Canada. Marine safety also carries out compliance oversight activities, such as inspection and certification services, to help ensure compliance with requirements.
Requirements apply to the construction and operation of both commercial vehicles and pleasure craft and include the training and certification of seafarers who operate and maintain them. The effective implementation and management of these programs mean the Canadian public can have confidence in the marine sector in this country.
One key program is the domestic vessel regulatory oversight program, which is responsible for helping ensure that substandard Canadian-flag vessels do not operate. Inspection and certification activities are carried out by highly qualified Transport Canada marine safety inspectors or by representatives of qualified organizations that have been granted delegated authority. Under the delegated statutory inspection program, Transport Canada has entered into agreements with certain classification societies to perform statutory vessel inspection and certification functions.
Small commercial vessels, which make up a significant portion of the Canadian fleet, have unique safety and operational requirements that are addressed in a new program known as the small vessel compliance program, or SVCP. The SVCP helps inform the owners and operators of small commercial vessels of their regulatory obligations under the Canada Shipping Act, 2001, and to verify that their vessels meet them. This new program has proven to be a very successful way to enhance the safe operation of these vessels and to increase compliance.
Port state control is a ship inspection program that inspects foreign-flagged vessels in our waters. It is a way to ensure that foreign vessels calling at Canadian ports comply with major international maritime conventions, thereby enhancing safety and protecting the environment.
 Transport Canada is also the lead federal department responsible for Canada's marine oil spill preparedness and response regime. This regime is in place to mitigate the impact of any marine pollution incidents in all Canadian waters. In this area, the department collaborates with Fisheries and Oceans Canada, the Canadian Coast Guard, and Environment Canada to ensure preparedness and response to oil spills. 
One important aspect of this regime is the national aerial surveillance program, or NASP. The program conducts aerial surveillance over all waters under Canadian jurisdiction using three aircraft with state-of-the-art remote sensing equipment that is so sensitive that it can detect marine oil spills as small as one litre. The information gathered is used to support enforcement action against polluters. Last winter, the minister actually participated in one of these surveillance flights. She saw first-hand that this is a very successful and worthwhile program.
As members are aware, our government is taking action to prevent marine oil spills from happening in the first place, to clean up spills quickly and effectively if they do happen, and to ensure that polluters pay. 
The hon. Denis Lebel, in his prior capacity as Minister of Transport, Infrastructure and Communities, and the hon. Joe Oliver, in his prior capacity as Minister of Natural Resources, announced the strategy to implement the world-class tanker safety system in March of last year. This is a comprehensive interdepartmental strategy, led by Transport Canada, that includes initiatives by Environment Canada, Fisheries and Oceans Canada, the Canadian Coast Guard, and Natural Resources Canada. With respect to preventing oil spills, we have put forward legislative amendments under Bill C-3 that would increase government oversight of oil-handling facilities, address issues of immunity for response organizations responding to a spill at one of these facilities, and strengthen requirements for pollution prevention and response at oil-handling facilities.
Other steps we have taken for which Transport Canada is responsible include increasing inspections of foreign tankers, reviewing existing pilotage and tug escort requirements, and launching the process to designate the Port of Kitimat public, which would require port traffic-control measures.
 We have also expanded the coverage of the NASP to provide even better aerial surveillance. In addition, the Canadian Coast Guard has invested in new and enhanced aids to navigation that will help mariners avoid accidents and prevent oil spills. Our government has also taken action to better prepare for and respond to marine oil spills if they do happen. The Canadian Coast Guard has moved to establish an incident command system to respond more effectively to any incidents by coordinating the operations of partners. Environment Canada has completed a study into the behaviour of diluted bitumen. This work has increased our understanding of the potential effects of spills on marine ecosystems.
We have also created the tanker safety expert panel to identify how the existing marine oil spill preparedness response regime can be further strengthened. The minister is now considering its recommendations on the current regime south of 60, and looks forward to the panel's second report on the regime in the Arctic and the marine transport of hazardous and noxious substances.
These are major steps, and I am proud that our government has delivered on the promises announced last year.
Finally, I would like to remind the members that marine safety is about more than just commercial shipping. We must also address recreational boating. Transport Canada's Office of Boating Safety, or the OBS, delivers programs that focus on prevention and that provide vital information for users and builders of recreational boats to enhance safety and reduce the environmental impacts of boating. Through the OBS, Transport Canada provides funding to organizations that promote boating safety or research ways to change people's behaviour on the water. These organizations have helped increase the number of boaters who follow safe boating practices. They also have contributed information about boating incidents that makes it possible for the OBS to set objectives to help reduce fatalities, injuries, and damage to property as a result of boating accidents.
The goal of the programs and measures I have outlined this evening is to help ensure that Canada benefits from the most effective marine safety system possible to protect people and the environment. Canadians can be confident that the minister's and Transport Canada's efforts are helping to make the marine transportation system in our country among the safest, most efficient, and most environmentally responsible in the world.",Conservative,Vancouver South,Wai Young,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=427b77c3-bbe5-4c5e-ad6a-2a31f7d79c77&Language=E&Section=ALL

I would also note that next week is Safe Boating Week, and I think it is important that we remember safety in recreational boating too. People should wear their life jackets and make sure they have everything they need to have on board for recreational boating.
I had the opportunity, as the hon. member said, to take a flight with the national aerial surveillance program. This is a unique program. The United States does not have this program. We have invested in this program, and we will make sure we invest in it more so that they can actually increase the number of hours they are out there patrolling the skies and being our eyes in the skies.
Specifically, I was particularly pleased to note that two members of the crew were women, so they have a nice gender balance in this program. It was very nice to be able to take off with them and to have the ability to view the paths of the vessels in the Vancouver area and to see the equipment they have, the sensor ability they have, the technology they have, and the skills they have to see both ships that are in distress and any spills, even as little, as was mentioned, as a litre of oil, because having that quick response is incredibly important.
I thoroughly enjoyed my time. We did not, unfortunately, see anything there with respect to any potential spills, but I can vouch for the absolute professionalism and the abilities of the crew on board this plane.
One other thing the crew told me was that it is such an incredibly valued program that they were the ones who were called upon by the United States to go down to the gulf to help be the eyes in the skies for the movement of oil on water when they had the Deepwater Horizon disaster, the oil spill in that part of the world. I am very proud of the work they did there and the commendations they have received as a result.

Lisa Raitt,Interjection,Government Orders,Business of Supply,"Transport—Main Estimates, 2014–15","Mr. Chair, fundamentally, we want to make sure that we are protecting the safety of Canadians and the safety of the environment, and as we make sure that we develop our resources responsibly and we open up those markets in other parts of the world, we want to transport our goods to market in the most environmentally responsible way. Part of that is with marine shipments. We know that as we increase the number of marine shipments through the west coast or the east coast, we will be faced with increased risk. 
We want to ensure that we are ahead of that. That is why we asked for a panel, chaired by a very well-respected captain, Captain Gordon Houston, who used to be the chair and CEO of Port Metro Vancouver, to look at what we currently have in terms of response and in terms of the system to take a safe system and make it even safer. He and his panel had 45 recommendations for the government, and we are taking them under due consideration and are ensuring that we consult with communities and get to the right place.
The importance of the world-class tanker is not just whether we are doing things as best we can for Canada. It is our reputation as well. It is world class for a reason. We are leading the world, when it comes to this kind of development, in ensuring that our marine transportation is as clean as possible and as safe as possible, and in the case of a spill, that we can respond to it as quickly as possible.

Regardless if someone is a pilot, or a teamster, or a marine operator, the fundamental aspect in transportation that runs through all of these is adherence to safety standards, and that is understood in whatever mode of transportation one is in.
Transport Canada inspectors have small and large airlines that they inspect thousands of times per year, and the proof of the pudding is this.

Airport authorities are the ones that set their charges. They are the ones that set their rates. They are the ones that ensure airlines come in and fly out and that passengers make it to them.
Our government has made some substantial infrastructure investments in and around airports in Canada through our economic action plans because we recognize the importance of air transport to a greater economy and to a better economy. While we focus on safety and security, we also want to ensure that as part of our entire economic plan, we want to include the air sector as part of that.

I would like to go back to rail safety, and I want to rely on the most objective document produced in the last two years in Canada, which is the report of the Auditor General, on rail safety. I want to review for Canadians a number of the Auditor General's key findings and conclusions.
First, the Auditor General and his team audited a three-year period at Transport Canada, which is this minister's department. She is the fifth minister in eight years, transiting through, I guess in terms of this cabinet, either up, down, or out. 
However, the Auditor General's report on whether federal railways have actually implemented safety management systems states that “Transport Canada has yet to establish an audit approach that provides a minimum level of assurance that federal railways have done so”.
That is number one, which flies in the face of the minister's assertion that there are SMSs as a world-class system in place.
Two, on safety, the Auditor General says that Transport Canada does not have clear timelines. The report states: “We found that the work plans are vague in terms of timelines for monitoring progress on important safety issues”.
Three, critical information is not available at Transport Canada. It cannot deliver up risk assessments. It cannot give us information on the sections of track used in transporting dangerous goods; and I think of Lac-Mégantic. It cannot give us information on the condition of railway bridges. It cannot give us financial information of privately owned federal railways not publicly available.
The Auditor General then tells us that Transport Canada, in the three fiscal years that were audited, actually only performed 14 audits. That is 14 audits when they themselves said that only constituted 25% of the audits that they said had to be done in order to keep rail safe in this country. In fact, in that three-year period, VIA Rail, which carries four million passengers a year, was not audited once. 
Not once.
I asked the minister earlier about qualified inspectors. In 2009, Transport Canada said that it needed 20 system auditors to audit each railway once every three years. How many were in place? There were only 10, half of what is required.
Next, the Auditor General tells us that Transport Canada does not know whether its current staff of inspectors have the required skills and competencies to do their jobs: “Inspectors and managers were not trained on a timely basis”. 
The Auditor General says that they cannot even warrant that inspectors are objective and independent because they are coming from the private sector and mainly from federal railways.
This is a scathing indictment of the last eight years, and five ministers, on rail safety. However, when we listen to the minister speak, all is good with rail safety, apparently. 
Can the minister explain to Canadians how it is possible that these findings are so serious that at committee, the Auditor General stated clearly that he is going to be adding another interim report to examine how much progress has been made under the current government.",Liberal,Ottawa South,David McGuinty,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=0992ca07-764f-4fa6-aa55-9a1f3f0a7327&Language=E&Section=ALL

Lisa Raitt,Interjection,Government Orders,Business of Supply,"Transport—Main Estimates, 2014–15","Mr. Chair, first of all, let me quote from the Auditor General's report in general, where it states that: “We did not examine the safety of federal and other railways’ operations. We also did not examine the overall safety of Canada’s rail industry”.
I stand by my comments about the safety of our rail industry and the importance of making it safer.
With respect to the recommendations, we did thank the Auditor General for his report and his recommendations because, clearly, a 26% audit is unacceptable. That is why the department was asked for a rail safety Office of the Auditor General action plan, which I have a copy of. The department is marked against it in terms of benchmarking. It has provided complete timelines; timely completion dates, which are needed; and it is monitored by me and my office on an ongoing basis. 
With respect to audits and auditors in training, in the spring of this year, all 100 inspectors will have the ability to conduct audits and they will be trained up. We will continue to hit those marks of 30,000-plus inspections each year, which are inspections that are exceeding greatly what we have done in the past. 
I can tell members that I said, when this report came out first in November, that should the department not be adhering to its action plan, I would not hesitate to ask the Auditor General to come back to review to ensure that this work is carried out. I stand by that statement now as well.",Conservative,Halton,Lisa Raitt,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=b6808e95-1c75-4909-ab86-319d3519016a&Language=E&Section=ALL

The Conservative government has known for eight years. I am absolutely certain that in the transition documents that were prepared for the minister's predecessor, the government was forewarned about this massive increase in the transportation of dangerous goods by rail. The present minister knows, and so does the Prime Minister, that in the next 10 years if every pipeline as proposed for our country is built and in full usage, there will be a million barrels per day of excess oil production in Canada. How is it going to be transported? It is going to be transported by rail.
Instead of taking the Auditor General's report, thanking him for his good work and sending him on his way, could the minister explain why there is no sense of urgency in the wake of the Lac-Mégantic tragedy? In the face of this massive increase in the transportation of dangerous goods, diluted bitumen by rail, why has there been no significant increase in expenditures for rail safety? We know from the public accounts of 2012-13, VIA Rail was cut 15%, aviation safety was cut 11%, marine safety was cut 25%, road safety was cut 5.5% and rail safety remained relatively constant.

Lisa Raitt,Interjection,Government Orders,Business of Supply,"Transport—Main Estimates, 2014–15","Mr. Chair, as I have already indicated, what the main estimates will show us is that aviation safety decreased as a result of a transfer of the airports capital assistance sub-program. It is not because of what the member said.
In terms of any reductions in either marine safety or in rail safety, they have all been administrative matters. They have nothing to do with safety. We would never cut inspector positions as a result.
With respect to rail safety, we started in 2007 on this path by studying rail. We are the ones who brought forward amendments to the Railway Safety Act. Yes, they were passed by everybody, but we moved them forward because we wanted to make it a safer system, recognizing it is safe. In fact, it has been quoted as being safe even by the former member for Trinity—Spadina, who said, “Shipping materials by train are...very safe and the record is really quite good”. She said that in October 2013, recognizing that the system was safe, and I agree with her on that topic.
We want to make it safer and we are reacting to what the Transportation Safety Board is indicating to us as it unfolds what happened at Lac-Mégantic. 
We have indicated protective directives need to be in place on sharing information with municipalities to deal with first responder issues.
We also made a protective directive with respect to prosper classification, knowing that this crude oil in particular was very unique and very different in the way it reacted.
We also directed, through a protective direction, to require shippers to develop ERAPs for the flammable liquids that I noted before. I have set up an ERAP task force. I have reached out to industry. We have had working groups.

Hopefully she will have a much better celebration in one of the nights to come, because this is not a great way to celebrate one's birthday.
That being said, Canada's rail system has been central to the development of this country. There are some 48,000 kilometres of track, enough to go around the world. We have one of the largest rail networks on the globe.
Rail has connected Canadians to each other and, by transporting Canadian goods to markets, is crucial to our economic prosperity. Some 70% of our surface freight moves by rail, including bulk commodities such as agricultural and forestry products, minerals, and energy products, including oil.
In recent years, more than 40% of our gross domestic product has been generated by bulk commodities. We use rail to move what are called dangerous goods. Dangerous goods play a vital role in the North American economy, but they are substances that could pose a threat to people or the environment. These shipments include oil and gas.
Every day such shipments move routinely and safely across Canada by rail without incident. Canadians depend on many of these goods to go about their daily lives. In fact, more than 30 million shipments of dangerous goods are transported annually in this country. Let me note again that almost all their destinations are reached without incident.
However, this past summer a tragic incident did occur. On July 6, an unmanned Montreal, Maine and Atlantic train containing crude oil derailed in Lac-Mégantic, Quebec. The explosion and fire that followed killed 47 people, caused significant damage to the town, and released more than five million litres of crude oil. The events in Lac-Mégantic underline the ongoing need for rail safety.
An on-site investigation was immediately launched by the Transportation Safety Board of Canada. The TSB provides an extremely valuable service to the government and Canadians. It operates independently of the government and makes recommendations following investigations into transportation incidents.
Earlier this year, the TSB made interim recommendations based on its ongoing investigation into the tragic Lac-Mégantic incident. Our government took decisive action to address the TSB recommendations.
Just recently, the Minister of Transport directed her department to further strengthen rail safety in Canada by removing the least crash-resistant DOT-111 tank cars from service; requiring DOT-111 tank cars that do not meet the standard published in January 2014 in Canada Gazette part 1 or any other future standard to be phased out within three years; requiring emergency response assistance plans for even a single tank car containing crude oil, gasoline, diesel, aviation fuel, or ethanol; creating a task force that brings municipalities, first responders, railways, and shippers together to strengthen emergency response capacity across the country; and requiring railway companies to reduce the speed of trains carrying dangerous goods and to implement other key operating practices.
However, I should note, given the integration of Canada and U.S. rail networks, that rail cars cross the border both ways every day, so we also require a North American solution. When it comes to developing a new standard for rail cars, we do not exist in isolation and must consider our training partners in the United States.
As such, the Minister of Transport continues to work with her American counterpart to accelerate the development of even more stringent standards in keeping with the TSB recommendations.
In addition, here in Parliament the minister has asked the Standing Committee on Transport, Infrastructure and Communities to review safety management systems for railways and the transport of dangerous goods. I mention this because I want to point out that Canada has in fact paid attention to safety in rail transportation. Those who say otherwise need to examine the facts.
In addition to the actions I have mentioned, our government is also taking other steps to address this important issue. On sharing TDG information with municipalities, the minister has stated that our government remains committed to a two-way dialogue and information exchange with key transportation stakeholders in communities across Canada. A protective direction was issued to make sure this happened.
On classification of dangerous goods, the minister announced a directive to ensure that all crude oil being transported is properly tested and classified and that results are sent to Transport Canada.
This provides Transport Canada with an additional means to monitor industry compliance and focus our efforts for the greatest safety benefit of Canadians.
When we look at all these actions together, we can see that our government is taking an approach that is similar to the world-class tanker safety initiative that we developed for marine transportation. It focuses on prevention, response, and liability. 
Our government is committed to rail safety and, prior to this tragedy, took numerous other actions to strengthen it. It is worth noting some of them. 
In 2009, we increased funding to ensure a permanent rail inspectorate of over 100 positions nationally. By last spring, Transport Canada had 101 railway safety inspectors and 35 dangerous goods inspectors. It has implemented a new, aggressive staffing plan to increase oversight capacity. For example, between April 1, 2012 and March 31, 2013, rail safety inspectors conducted more than 30,000 inspections. Our government has also invested more than $100 million in the rail safety system. 
We have also taken legislative steps. Last year, final amendments to the Railway Safety Act went into effect, providing the authority to introduce new regulations to strengthen safety and oversight programs. These new regulations include increased fines for companies that break rules, a requirement that rail carriers submit environmental management plans, the creation of whistle-blower protection for employees with safety concerns, and a call for rail companies to have an executive legally responsible for safety.
I want to also note other measures we took immediately following the events in Lac Mégantic. The Minister of Transport  directed her department to issue an emergency directive to rail companies, with five requirements: two operators are required at all times for trains carrying dangerous goods; all cabins must be locked; all reverses must be removed from locomotives; all brakes must be properly applied on all locomotives; and no trains can be left unattended without new strict conditions. Our government made these rules permanent. 
These actions would build on steps that Transport Canada is also taking to bolster the safety of our rails and the transportation of dangerous goods. To this end, we have said we will work to enhance the collection of safety data and the tools to analyze safety risks and improve and expand the fleet of vehicles used to assess rail tracks. We will improve how information about dangerous goods shipments is shared with municipalities, conduct research to support safety technologies, promote a culture of safety in the rail industry, and continue to work with communities across Canada and groups such as the Federation of Canadian Municipalities to further support the work of municipal emergency preparedness officials and first responders.
We also continue to strengthen rail safety through other actions. That is why, even before the investigations into this tragedy were completed, the minister directed officials in her department to speed up development and implementation of regulations that reflect recent amendments to the Railway Safety Act. In doing so, there are several questions we need to consider. For example, do our current regimes and options adequately reflect risks of transporting crude oil and other dangerous goods? As we did in developing the world-class tanker safety regime, should we reassess the liability and compensation regime for rail transport to better protect victims, the environment, and taxpayers? 
Given the integration of the Canada-U.S. rail network, and in order to improve rail efficiency together, we should work to develop a new continental co-operation on rail safety. 
As I noted earlier, we are already doing some of these. 
As a first step, the Canadian Transportation Agency is reviewing its insurance assessment criteria and will take actions permitted under existing legislation. As well, Transport Canada will review how much insurance may be required in order to adequately compensate people and pay for cleanups after accidents. From that, we expect to bring forward options to improve this regime and ensure it adequately reflects the risks of transporting crude and other dangerous goods. 
Beyond what government can do with its own powers, we must also encourage transportation businesses to encourage a culture of safety in their everyday operations, and the sense among employees that they can all contribute to safe operations. By accomplishing this, these businesses can maintain government's trust and have confidence that we will support their enterprise. 
In conclusion, let me make a couple of key points. First, railway safety regulations exist to ensure the safety and protection of the public. If these regulations are not followed, we will not hesitate to act, and if companies do not properly classify the goods they transport, they may be prosecuted under the Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act. 
Second, Canada has a robust and safe transportation system, one in which we can have confidence. The facts demonstrate that Canada is pursuing rail safety and that our record has improved in recent years. However, events in Lac-Mégantic remind us that we must remain committed to strengthening rail safety. To do so, we will learn from recent events and work with all stakeholders in rail transportation to ensure the safety of our rail system for Canadians. 
We recognize that there is still some work to do, and we remain committed to working with the rail industry, governments, and partners such as the Federation of Canadian Municipalities to improve the safety of our rail and transportation of dangerous goods systems.
With that, I have a question for the minister. I was wondering if the minister could comment on whether, in light of what I have said in my speech, she is confident in the direction we are taking and whether it will maintain the safety of our transportation and trade system.",Conservative,Elmwood--Transcona,Lawrence Toet,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=7a4f8db3-76e7-4e83-ab76-883371f0f4d2&Language=E&Section=ALL

Of course, we can always do better. We will always strive to do better, and we will continue to take that path at Transport Canada. That being said, I am satisfied with the reaction we have been receiving to all of these protective directions, emergency orders, and regulations we are putting in place or announcing. 
I will take a moment to show that it is not just internally that we should be happy with ourselves. Externally we have heard from people like Claude Dauphin, president of the Federation of Canadian Municipalities, who stated:
 FCM applauds the federal government's response to the tragedy in Lac Mégantic and to the rail safety recommendations that emerged from it. 
 He went on to say:
 The government's commitment to increase the safety of the transportation of dangerous goods, and to require shippers and railways to carry additional insurance, directly respond to calls from FCM's national rail safety working group. 
As well, it is important to note that Rebecca Blaikie, who is the NDP president, said on April 23, in response to our comments to the Transportation Safety Board, that she thinks this is a step in the right direction. She said she was glad to see the government taking action.
The member for Brossard—La Prairie also said:
 It is a good move. It is a step in the right direction. 
He also said that the three-year period is the best thing that can be done.
The mayor of Lac-Mégantic, with whom we have a very good relationship, a respectful one, and it is important for us to consult with her, as she is the centre of so much of what's been happening recently in rail safety, said she was satisfied with the new measures from the federal government.
The chair of the Transportation Safety Board said she was encouraged by our strong response to the board recommendations. 
Claude Dauphin also said:
 The new safety measures announced today respond directly to our call for concrete action and are another major step forward in improving the safety of Canada's railways and the communities around them. 
I also want to thank the Canadian Association of Fire Chiefs, which commended us for requiring emergency response assistance plans for the shipment of crude oil, ethanol, and other flammable liquids by rail.

It is my pleasure to speak to the House tonight on the help the federal government provides to municipalities and first responders.
First responders are the front line in public safety and when an emergency occurs, multiple 911 calls flow into municipal emergency centres. This begins the all-important response by police, fire, and ambulance personnel to the scene of the incident. Without this vital safety link, Canadians’ lives would be placed further at risk.
That is why our government recognizes the importance of proper first responder capability and has provided assistance to municipalities to ensure that Canadians have access to the support they require following an incident related to the transportation of dangerous goods.
For example, our government has allocated funding to support municipalities, and a portion of that funding is being provided by Public Safety Canada toward helping in the response and recovery in Lac-Mégantic.
By their very nature, the vast majority of emergencies in this country are dealt with at the local level; by provincial, territorial, and municipal governments. Under Canada's emergency management system, first responders and provincial officials are responsible for addressing the immediate needs of their residents in times of disaster. However, the federal government can and does play an important role through the disaster financial assistance agreements, particularly when communities are devastated by a large-scale natural disaster.
These arrangements were put in place to provide financial assistance to provinces and territories, on a cost-shared basis, when response and recovery costs for a natural disaster exceed what they could reasonably be expected to bear on their own. Through this program, our government has provided more than $2.5 billion in post-disaster assistance to help provinces and territories with the costs of response and of restoring infrastructure and personal property to pre-disaster condition.
However, as we learned last summer, our communities can be shattered by incidents that do not fall into the category of large-scale natural disasters. The unprecedented nature of the Lac-Mégantic tragedy was such that our government was compelled to find an exceptional and rapid funding response. In the face of such a devastating and immediate impact, it was clear that there was no time to waste. The priority was to deliver immediate help to the people whose lives had been ripped apart. With its commitment to provide $60 million to the province of Quebec, that is exactly what our government did. Since then, we have also provided up to $95 million to help with the decontamination of the water and soil.
In addition, to help meet this extraordinary need, Public Safety Canada committed to provide $25 million of the total funds, to help the Province of Quebec in its immediate response and recovery efforts, as well as to help repair, rebuild, and restore this devastated community.
The funds provided could be directed to a number of eligible costs, which would include: the delivery of emergency services; rescue, transportation, and emergency food and shelter; the registration of people who were displaced from their homes due to the destruction; incremental short-term security measures, including removing valuable assets and hazardous material from the sites; emergency provision of essential community services; the removal of damaged structures that constituted a threat to public safety; repairs to public infrastructure, such as roads and bridges; and finally, the cleanup costs.
Since this announcement, our government continues to work with officials in the Province of Quebec and Lac-Mégantic to ensure that provincial requests for federal assistance are handled without delay. The health and safety of Canadians is our government's top priority, and this funding is just another example of how we are working closely with the provinces and territories to assist Canadians when large disasters strike.
We continue to support first responders to make sure they have access to information that may assist them in dealing with an incident. 
That is why on November 20, 2013, my colleague the hon. Minister of Transport took action to make sure that municipalities and first responders have access to information about dangerous goods that flow through their communities. This government has obligated industry to provide municipal emergency planners and first responders with the information they need to conduct proper risk assessments, emergency planning, and first-responder training.
Moreover, the Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act, 1992, provides the federal government with the necessary authorities to develop policy, verify compliance, conduct research to enhance safety, guide emergency response, and develop regulations and standards to manage risk during the transportation of dangerous goods.
To further help municipalities deal with an emergency, the transportation of dangerous goods directorate within Transport Canada, operates the Canadian Transport Emergency Centre, CANUTEC, to assist emergency response personnel in handling dangerous goods emergencies. This world-renowned centre is staffed by bilingual professional scientists, specialized in emergency response and experienced in interpreting technical information and providing advice to first responders.
The centre operates 24 hours a day and handles some 30,000 phone calls a year related to safety. Delegations from around the world regularly visit CANUTEC to incorporate Canadian practices into their own countries' dangerous goods programs.
 CANUTEC was involved immediately after the incident in Lac-Mégantic, providing first responders involved in the tragic incident with information regarding potential hazards of the dangerous goods, evacuation distance, train consist information, and protective clothing requirements, among others.
First responders regularly communicate the importance and necessity of CANUTEC to help them accomplish their response work and to understand the risks associated with the transportation of dangerous goods. CANUTEC also offers first responders access to immediate dangerous goods information following an incident.
A rail operator is required by regulation to provide CANUTEC with the train consist immediately following an incident. This train consist provides first responders with detailed information on the specific products the train in question was transporting, beyond the general information provided by the placards on the cars. This is much more detailed information.
It allows CANUTEC specialists to target detailed advice on handling products, which may have spilled and mixed, or recommended initial evacuation zones. It enables them to understand immediately what risks they face when they are involved in an incident.
This existing requirement for immediate information to be provided to first responders through CANUTEC, in combination with the new requirements to provide municipalities with historical information through the protective direction, demonstrates our government's commitment to support first responders with the information they require to respond to a dangerous goods incident.
We are fortunate. Anyone involved in emergency response and the transportation of dangerous goods safety knows the importance of CANUTEC and its emergency response guidebook. This guidebook, produced by Transport Canada, helps first responders, police, fire, ambulance and paramedics, to respond and protect Canadians during the initial phase of a dangerous goods incident.
The emergency response guidebook is an informative and comprehensive guide designed for use at a dangerous goods incident occurring on a highway, aircraft, ship or railroad. It enables first responders to quickly identify the specific or generic hazards of the material involved in an incident. The guidebook is used by many first responders. It is something that is widely provided.
Could the minister clarify a number of oversight positions for each mode of transportation, and for the transport of dangerous goods? After she has done that, perhaps she could comment on the January 23 Transportation Safety Board-issued recommendations regarding emergency response assistance plans, ERAPs. Perhaps the minister could tell the House what actions our government took to respond to these recommendations.",Conservative,Souris--Moose Mountain,Ed Komarnicki,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=80848abe-ba61-4f7d-9039-c936536f540a&Language=E&Section=ALL

Lisa Raitt,Interjection,Government Orders,Business of Supply,"Transport—Main Estimates, 2014–15","Mr. Chair, at the beginning of the evening, a mere three hours ago, I gave the correct number when it came to the number of civil aviation oversight inspectors. I gave the incorrect number in the last round of questioning. I just want to make sure that for the purposes of the record, I am clear that in civil aviation the oversight positions numbers are 1137 and not what I said, which was the total number, 1707.
I thank the hon. member for catching me on that one and ensuring that we have the record sorted out, and I am delighted that he talked about a topic that is very important to us.
With regard to what happened in Lac-Mégantic, the first meeting I had was in Lac-Mégantic with the mayor of Lac-Mégantic, and from there I met the local mayors ten days later. The one thing that came out of it was the importance of understanding that first responders needed to have certain information and, second, that they needed to ensure that they had a communication line open with the rail companies in their area.
That is what we have been trying to do through our protective directives, the first one having to do with the information and the second one, which we just did, having to do with emergency preparedness along Canada's railway lines.
As the member pointed out, an ERAP, or emergency response assistance plan, is a formal plan. It is what industry says it will do to support first responders, the ones first on the scene in the event of an accident involving dangerous goods. Sometimes it requires special expertise and sometimes it requires special response equipment. An ERAP helps municipalities and local emergency responders by providing them with around-the-clock technical expertise and specifically trained and equipped emergency response personnel at the scene of an accident.
The ERAP describes specialized response capabilities and equipment that would be used to support response to incidents involving higher-risk dangerous goods. It addresses emergency preparedness, personnel training, response exercises, and equipment maintenance.
As the hon. member also pointed out, CANUTEC supports first responders as well. Transport Canada's 24-hour emergency centre is staffed with scientists who provide real-time information and emergency responses by the first responders following an accident or an incident, something which the municipalities told us they wanted to have.
Prior to my announcement on April 23, regulations required an ERAP for certain volatile refined fuels, such as gasoline or diesel, when there were a large number of cars in interconnected trains. The requirement did not apply to crude oil or if a smaller number of cars were transported.
ERAP requirements are now being expanded to include specific flammable liquids transported in large volumes by train. The protective directives that we put in place require shippers to develop these ERAPs for flammable liquids like crude oil, gasoline, diesel, aviation fuel, and ethanol. An ERAP is required even when it is just a single tank. I think that is an important specific issue with respect to how we are dealing with this matter.
Industry must submit the ERAP to Transport Canada for approval within 150 days, and we have set up a task force as well to facilitate even further more recommendations that may be made by the transportation of dangerous goods general policy advisory committee's emergency response working group.",Conservative,Halton,Lisa Raitt,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=b6808e95-1c75-4909-ab86-319d3519016a&Language=E&Section=ALL

Let me commend the minister as well, who is doing a fine job in the transport portfolio. She is demonstrating that she is one of the ablest transport ministers Canada has ever had.
I am thankful to our senior officials as well, who are dedicated public servants, and their team of literally thousands of dedicated, non-partisan public servants at Transport Canada who do diligent work day after day to ensure that Canadians remain safe and that public safety is taken seriously.
Obviously there are ministerial staff who work very closely with the minister day by day to ensure that priorities are achieved. They work not according to the clock, but beyond the clock, until tasks are finished. That is critical.
There are members of the Standing Committee on Transport, Infrastructure and Communities who are here today in support of the minister. They do phenomenal work, particularly in a study right now on all modes of transport involved with safety management systems and the transportation of dangerous goods by rail, water, air, and truck. We are doing important work to support what the minister is doing. We are doing that with members opposite. It is all about important public safety.
I want to ask a couple of questions.
First, in response to the member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine, I think there is an important clarification the minister wants to get on the record with respect to Aéroports de Montréal.
Second, and also my favourite topic, is the economic importance of the Detroit River international crossing. What progress is happening on that, and why is this government and not the opposition importantly positioned to deliver on this key project for this nation, the number one infrastructure priority of this government?",Conservative,Essex,Jeff Watson,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=379a808d-9183-4a07-90c7-cdeb0ec3de63&Language=E&Section=ALL

Lisa Raitt,Interjection,Government Orders,Business of Supply,"Transport—Main Estimates, 2014–15","Mr. Chair, to respond to the member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine, as I mentioned, Aéroports de Montréal is required to have noise management plans. They have a noise management committee. What I would like to draw to attention is that each time an apparent irregularity is noted, the airport informs Transport Canada, and the ministry then decides on an appropriate action. The list of offences and offenders is available on Transport Canada's website.
I am happy to talk about the new Detroit River international crossing because it is something that has a two-fold purpose. 
First, it will help us so much in terms of trade and in terms of jobs, growth, and long-term prosperity. It is one of those projects that comes along once in a generation, a project that we can be absolutely proud of. I am proud of all of the work that the parliamentary secretary has been doing on this, following it from its very beginning. He has been a very big cheerleader and has been involved every step of the way. I am grateful to have his expertise and his experience on this file as we move forward together to ensure that this bridge gets built.
It has to get built, because we need it for growing trade and to deal with traffic at the busiest U.S.-Canada commercial border crossing. Thousands of jobs will be created. Eight million American jobs and two million Canadian jobs depend on trade and investment between our two countries, so having this link will help ensure that we support those kinds of jobs between our two countries.
It is also going to be a much-needed crossing alternative because it is expected as well to create 10,000 to 15,000 construction jobs in Ontario and Michigan.
Our government will continue to move forward on this project. Budget 2014 is providing over $630 million for construction of the new bridge. We are at the point in time where we will be naming the CEO, setting up the crown corporation, assembling the lands, and beginning construction and procurement of this bridge.
It is something I am proud of. I am proud of the involvement of the parliamentary secretary as well. I am grateful for his question.",Conservative,Halton,Lisa Raitt,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=b6808e95-1c75-4909-ab86-319d3519016a&Language=E&Section=ALL
